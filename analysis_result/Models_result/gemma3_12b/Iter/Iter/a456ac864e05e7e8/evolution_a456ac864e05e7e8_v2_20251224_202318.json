      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace data and generate three bypass patterns following the provided guidelines.\n\n**Phase 1: Factual Outcome & Instruction Sequence**\n\nThe program exits via `ExitProcess`. The sequence leading to the exit differs slightly between the two traces, but the key difference is the final instruction. Trace 1 calls `0040E7C3h`, and Trace 2 calls an address stored in memory at `0041B0ACh`. Both end in a call, which likely triggers the exit.\n\n**Phase 2 & 3: Counterfactual Hypotheses & Evaluation**\n\nLet's examine the potential bypass points, prioritizing those where skipping seems most likely to continue execution.\n\n* **Instruction at 0040E7F6 (Trace 1): `E8C8FFFFFF` (call 0040E7C3h)**\n    * Factual: Call executes → exit\n    * Counterfactual: Skip call → Would execution continue? Likely, yes. This call is the immediate trigger for the exit in Trace 1.\n    * Necessity: Yes, skipping is necessary to prevent exit.\n    * Sufficiency: Likely sufficient, as this is the immediate trigger.\n\n* **Instruction at 0040E7FF (Trace 2): `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh])**\n    * Factual: Call executes → exit\n    * Counterfactual: Skip call → Would execution continue? Likely, yes.  This call is the immediate trigger for the exit in Trace 2.\n    * Necessity: Yes, skipping is necessary to prevent exit.\n    * Sufficiency: Likely sufficient, as this is the immediate trigger.\n\n* **Instruction at 0040E7F3: `FF7508` (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])**\n    * Factual: Pushes a value from the stack onto the stack.\n    * Counterfactual: Skip push → Would execution continue? Possibly, but less likely than skipping the final call.  The value being pushed might be critical for later execution.\n    * Necessity: Not necessarily.\n    * Sufficiency: Not likely.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 Bypass Points**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best bypass points are the two calls. We'll pick one from each trace to ensure the bypass works for both execution paths.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nNow, let's create the patterns, including context bytes and applying wildcards.\n\n**Pattern 0 (Trace 1 bypass):**\n\n`8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508` (17 bytes) - Includes the instructions leading up to the call.  This will cover the entire exit sequence in Trace 1.\n\n**Pattern 1 (Trace 2 bypass):**\n\n`8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100` (17 bytes) - Includes the instructions leading up to the call. This will cover the entire exit sequence in Trace 2.\n\n**Pattern 2 (Context around the first instruction):**\n\n`8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508` (12 bytes) - Includes the instructions leading up to the first call. This covers the common instructions before the divergence.\n\n**YARA Rule Output:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Choices:**\n\n*   **Pattern Length:** All patterns are within the 6-20 byte limit.\n*   **Wildcards:** No wildcards are needed as there are no addresses or offsets in the chosen sequences.\n*   **Context:**  The patterns include surrounding instructions to provide context and reduce the risk of unintended matches.\n*   **Different Sequences:** The patterns are distinct hex sequences.\n*   **Cape Options:** Correctly references the patterns.\n*   **Trace Coverage:**  The bypasses target the key differences between the two traces.\n*   **Instruction Combination:** Instructions are combined to create larger, more robust patterns.\n",
