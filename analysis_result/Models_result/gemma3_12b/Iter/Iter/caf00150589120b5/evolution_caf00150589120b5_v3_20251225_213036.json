To broaden the rule and target the decision-making process before `ExitProcess`, I've selected three distinct patterns from the trace, focusing on conditional jumps and stack manipulations often involved in evasion checks. I am prioritizing Strategy B (EXIT DECISION) and Strategy A (EVASION CHECK) as the previous rule hit, suggesting a location close to the exit.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target conditional checks and stack modifications before the `ExitProcess` call, aiming to bypass the evasion logic without directly altering the exit itself.

The analysis suggested broadening patterns with wildcards and focusing on broader behavioral characteristics.
