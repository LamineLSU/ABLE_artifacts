This suggests the need to focus on specific conditional checks preceding the ExitProcess call. I'm implementing Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting instructions involved in checking conditions before the final exit. The patterns are chosen to match specific instruction sequences observed in the trace, incorporating wildcards for addresses and offsets to account for variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns target critical sections of code related to the exit process. The first pattern targets a `test` instruction followed by a conditional jump, a common pattern in evasion checks. The second pattern targets an API call (likely related to process termination) preceded by a conditional check. The third pattern focuses on a comparison operation that might be part of the decision-making process before exiting. The wildcards allow for flexibility in addresses and offsets, increasing the likelihood of bypassing the evasion mechanism while minimizing false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
