This suggests the initial rule was too broad or targeted the wrong section of code. We need to refine the rule to focus on a specific decision point or check related to the exit process, potentially before the actual exit call. This evolution focuses on a conditional check before the exit, aligning with Strategy B. We're selecting three distinct patterns that appear to be part of the conditional logic leading to the ExitProcess call.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns were chosen to target a common conditional check before an API call. The use of concrete bytes ensures a more precise match, reducing the likelihood of false positives. The inclusion of wildcards for addresses allows for some flexibility while maintaining specificity.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 33 FD FF FF }\n        $pattern2 = { 8D 95 F0 FE FF FF 89 9D F0 FE FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
