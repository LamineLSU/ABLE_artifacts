Given the \"any of them\" condition, we need to refine the patterns to be more targeted. We'll focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check), targeting potential checks before the ExitProcess calls. We will select three distinct patterns from the trace that seem to represent conditional logic or checks, based on the instruction sequences.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are selected to target different potential evasion checks before the ExitProcess calls. The first pattern focuses on a call followed by a test and jump, common in conditional checks. The second focuses on an API call, which might be involved in the evasion logic. The third focuses on a comparison and jump, another common conditional structure. The cape options will allow for skipping these sections.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern1 = { FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83F80174128B4D }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
