The analysis suggested a more aggressive approach to alter program state or control flow. This evolution focuses on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting specific conditional jumps before the ExitProcess call.  Instead of skipping instructions, we will attempt to alter the flow by using jumps.

The `CALL_TEST_JE` pattern aims to disrupt the logic leading to the exit. The `API_CHECK` pattern targets a check related to API calls, and the `CMP_SETZ` targets a comparison that may affect the execution flow.  The use of concrete bytes where possible increases specificity and reduces the risk of false positives.
