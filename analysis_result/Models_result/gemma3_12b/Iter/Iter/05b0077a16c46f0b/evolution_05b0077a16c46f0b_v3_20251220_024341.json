The current approach focuses on targeting the conditional check before the `ExitProcess` call, as this is a likely decision point for evasion logic. The patterns chosen are from the trace and aim to bypass specific checks rather than directly manipulating the exit process itself. I'm also introducing cape options to skip specific instruction sequences.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The chosen patterns target the conditional jump based on the result of a test instruction, which is a common pattern for evasion checks. The wildcards are used to account for variations in addresses and offsets.  The cape options will skip these instructions, attempting to bypass the check.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
