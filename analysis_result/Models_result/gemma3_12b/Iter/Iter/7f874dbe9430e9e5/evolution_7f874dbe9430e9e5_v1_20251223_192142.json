This suggests the rule was too specific and needs to be relaxed by incorporating wildcards to account for variations in instruction order and register usage. We will focus on identifying unique instruction sequences related to the exit process and potential checks before it, as suggested in the improvement suggestions. We're shifting away from fixed skip offsets (CAPE_OPTIONS) and focusing on identifying more general patterns. We will target instruction sequences before the exit call to look for conditional checks.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns are designed to identify sequences of instructions commonly associated with API checks and conditional logic before the ExitProcess call. The wildcards allow for variations in addresses and register usage, increasing the likelihood of bypassing the evasion while still hitting the target.  The patterns are all derived directly from the provided trace to ensure accuracy.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
