      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and generate three bypass patterns following the given guidelines.\n\n**Phase 1 & 2: Factual Outcome & Counterfactual Hypotheses**\n\nThe program exits via `ExitProcess`.  The immediate preceding instructions are crucial.  The trace data shows two identical sequences leading to the exit, differing only in the final instruction.  The key divergence point is `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]) in the second trace and `E8C8FFFFFF` (call 0040E7C3h) in the first. Let's focus on these.\n\n**Phase 3: Evaluating Hypotheses**\n\n*Counterfactual 1:*  Skipping `E8C8FFFFFF` (call 0040E7C3h) in Trace 1.  This is the first exit point.\n    - Factual: Executes \u2192 leads to exit\n    - Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?  Likely, yes.  It's a function call; skipping it *might* allow the program to continue.\n    - Necessity: Possibly necessary.  It's the direct cause of the exit in Trace 1.\n    - Sufficiency: Possibly sufficient. It's a good candidate.\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* Skipping `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]) in Trace 2. This is the second exit point.\n    - Factual: Executes \u2192 leads to exit\n    - Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue? Likely, yes.  Indirect call, skipping it *might* allow the program to continue.\n    - Necessity: Possibly necessary.  It's the direct cause of the exit in Trace 2.\n    - Sufficiency: Possibly sufficient. It's a good candidate.\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* Skipping the `FF7508` (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]) instruction preceding the call in both traces.\n    - Factual: Executes \u2192 leads to exit\n    - Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue? Less likely to be sufficient alone, as the call is likely dependent on the value pushed onto the stack.\n    - Necessity: Less necessary.\n    - Sufficiency: Less sufficient.\n\n**Phase 4: Selecting Bypass Points**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best bypass points are skipping the calls in Trace 1 and 2. Let's create patterns around those.\n\n**Phase 5: Building Patterns & Applying Wildcards**\n\nHere are the three patterns, adhering to the length and wildcard rules.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }  // Trace 1: Skipping call 0040E7C3h (17 bytes)\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 } // Trace 2: Skipping call dword ptr [0041B0ACh] (17 bytes)\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 59 } // Combining parts of both traces (19 bytes)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** Skips the call in Trace 1. Includes preceding instructions to provide context.\n*   **$pattern1:** Skips the call in Trace 2. Includes preceding instructions to provide context.\n*   **$pattern2:** Combines the first part of Trace 1 with the call from Trace 2.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specificity:**  The wildcards help make the patterns more general and less likely to trigger on unrelated code.\n*   **Context:**  Including a few surrounding instructions is important for the bypass to be effective and avoid unintended consequences.\n*   **Testing:** These patterns are theoretical.  They *must* be tested in a real environment to confirm their effectiveness.\n*   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** If ASLR is enabled, the addresses `0041B0ACh` and `0040E7C3h` will change.  This would require adjusting the patterns accordingly.\n*   **Trace Variations:** Malware often has slight variations in its execution.  If the bypass fails, it may be necessary to adjust the patterns to account for these variations.\n",

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

We'll shift focus to earlier parts of the trace, employing Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision). I'll prioritize patterns that look like conditional checks preceding the `ExitProcess` calls.

The goal is to identify the decision-making process, not just the execution of the exit function.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target instructions likely involved in a pre-exit check. The first pattern focuses on a test and conditional jump. The second pattern focuses on a comparison instruction. The third pattern targets a call instruction that might be related to the check.

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts resulted in rule hits but no new signatures, indicating that the rule was hitting the target but not bypassing the evasion. This suggests the rule was too specific and needs to be relaxed by incorporating wildcards to account for variations in instruction order and register usage. We will focus on identifying unique instruction sequences related to the exit process and potential checks before it, as suggested in the improvement suggestions.

We will target instruction sequences before the exit call to look for conditional checks.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns are designed to identify sequences of instructions commonly associated with API checks and conditional logic before the ExitProcess call.
