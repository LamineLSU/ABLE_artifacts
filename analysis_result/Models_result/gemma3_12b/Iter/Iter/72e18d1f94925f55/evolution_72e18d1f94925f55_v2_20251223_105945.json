      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace data and generate 3 bypass patterns following the given guidelines. I'll focus on the most likely candidates that, if skipped, would allow execution to continue.\n\n**Analysis & Pattern Selection**\n\nThe malware appears to be checking for a Wine environment. The core logic involves checking a FS register and then calling functions at `04F4026Fh`, `04F40275h`, and `04F903C4h`, `04F903CAh`.  The final `call 74DF4100h` seems to be the exit point triggered by the Wine detection.\n\nBased on counterfactual reasoning, the most likely bypass points are instructions that lead directly to the calls that trigger the exit. I'll choose three different bypass candidates.\n\n**Pattern 1: Bypassing the initial Wine check and first call**\n\nThis pattern targets the check for Wine and the first call.  Skipping these instructions would allow the malware to bypass the initial check and potentially continue execution.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - initial Wine check\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 64 A1 30 00 00 00 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01 75 10 }\n        // mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]\n        // mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]\n        // shr eax, 08h\n        // test al, 01h\n        // jne 009B655Ah\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: Bypassing the second call**\n\nThis pattern targets the second call. Skipping this call would bypass another potential Wine detection check.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - second call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern1 = { 50 57 E8 BF 31 E7 04 }\n        // push eax\n        // pop edi\n        // call 04F903C4h\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern 3: Bypassing the final call**\n\nThis pattern targets the final `call 74DF4100h`. This is likely the instruction that terminates the process.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - final call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern2 = { E8 94 DB CB 74 }\n        // call 74DF4100h\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards & Context:**\n\n*   **Pattern 1:**  No wildcards are needed because all bytes are necessary to represent the instruction sequence.\n*   **Pattern 2:** No wildcards are needed because all bytes are necessary to represent the instruction sequence.\n*   **Pattern 3:**  No wildcards are needed because all bytes are necessary to represent the instruction sequence.\n\n**Combined YARA Rule (for easy copy/paste):**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 64 A1 30 00 00 00 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01 75 10 }\n        $pattern1 = { 50 57 E8 BF 31 E7 04 }\n        $pattern2 = { E8 94 DB CB 74 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Testing:** These patterns are based on analysis, but they need to be tested in a real environment to verify their effectiveness.\n*   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** If ASLR is enabled, the addresses `04F4026Fh`, `04F40275h`, `04F903C4h`, `04F903CAh`, and `74DF4100h` will be different in each execution.  This means the bypass may not work consistently.\n*   **Obfuscation:** Malware authors often use obfuscation techniques to make analysis difficult.  These patterns might need to be adjusted to account for obfuscation.\n*   **Multiple Bypass Points:**  The malware might have multiple detection mechanisms.  More bypass patterns might be needed to fully bypass the evasion.\n*   **Context:** The effectiveness of these bypasses depends on the surrounding code.  Skipping the wrong instruction could have unintended consequences.\n*   **Trace Variation:** Trace #1 and Trace #2 have slightly different instructions at some points. This could be due to conditional execution or other factors.  The patterns should be robust enough to handle these variations.\n",
