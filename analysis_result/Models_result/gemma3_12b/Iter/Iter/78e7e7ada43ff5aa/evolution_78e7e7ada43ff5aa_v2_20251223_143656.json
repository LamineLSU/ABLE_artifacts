        "Instead of blindly skipping the entire sequence, try a more targeted bypass. The sequence starting with `85 C0` seems to be a check of a register, and the `0F 84` is a conditional jump. It's likely that the bypass is disrupting the flow based on the result of that register check. Instead of skipping the whole sequence, try to preserve the register's value (e.g., by duplicating it before the jump). This might allow the program to continue execution in a more predictable way, potentially revealing more valuable signatures.  Alternatively, a more detailed analysis of the surrounding code might reveal a more suitable point to insert a bypass that doesn't disrupt the program's core logic."

I'm shifting to a strategy focusing on the conditional check before the `ExitProcess` call, as this is likely where the decision to exit is made.  I'm also incorporating more concrete byte sequences from the trace to increase specificity and reduce false positives. I will use a combination of `test eax, eax` and conditional jumps (`je`) to target the decision logic.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: Targeting the conditional jump after `test eax, eax` is a reasonable approach to bypassing the exit decision. The specific byte sequences selected are from the trace and represent a common pattern for conditional checks.  The use of concrete bytes minimizes the risk of false positives, while the inclusion of `je` instructions targets the conditional logic.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 45 FC }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
