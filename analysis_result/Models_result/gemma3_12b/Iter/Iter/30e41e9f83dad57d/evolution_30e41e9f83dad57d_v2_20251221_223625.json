To address this, I'm shifting focus to Strategy A - targeting the evasion check before the ExitProcess call. I'm selecting patterns that include a `TEST` instruction followed by a conditional jump (`JE` or `JNE`), which are common in evasion checks.  I am also incorporating wildcards to allow for variations in offsets within the check. I'm also adding a third pattern to increase the chance of bypassing.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are chosen from the trace and target the conditional logic preceding the ExitProcess call. The wildcards allow for slight variations in the code, increasing the likelihood of a successful bypass.  The inclusion of `TEST` and conditional jump instructions specifically targets the evasion check itself, rather than the exit action.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
