Let's target these, along with the surrounding conditional checks.\n\n**Pattern 1: Targeting the First Call**\n\nThe first call we're interested in is at `0040CDDD`.  Let's include the preceding check and some context.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - First Call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 77 0A FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n*   `77 0A`: JBE instruction, which is a conditional jump.\n*   `FF 15 BC 36 61 00`: CALL instruction. This is the target.\n*   This pattern is 7 bytes long and covers the `JBE` and `CALL` instructions.\n\n**Pattern 2: Targeting the Call at 0040CF9D**\n\nLet's target the second call we're interested in at `0040CF9D`. Let's include the preceding check and some context.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Second Call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 00 FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n*   `6A 00`: PUSH instruction.\n*   `FF 15 BC 36 61 00`: CALL instruction. This is the target.\n*   This pattern is 7 bytes long and covers the `PUSH` and `CALL` instructions.\n\n**Pattern 3: Targeting the Call at 0040CFDD**\n\nLet's target the third call we're interested in at `0040CFDD`. Let's include the preceding check and some context.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Third Call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern2 = { 8D 7C 24 0C AB FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n*   `8D 7C 24 0C`: LEA instruction.\n*   `AB`: STOSD instruction.\n*   `FF 15 BC 36 61 00`: CALL instruction. This is the target.\n*   This pattern is 9 bytes long and covers the `LEA`, `STOSD` and `CALL` instructions.\n\n**Final YARA Rule:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 77 0A FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 00 FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8D 7C 24 0C AB FF 15 BC 36 61 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   The `cape_options` attribute specifies that the patterns should be used as bypass points.  `bp0`, `bp1`, and `bp2` refer to the respective patterns, and `action0`, `action1`, and `action2` are set to `skip`.\n*   The `condition` ensures that the rule triggers if any of the defined patterns are found.\n\nThis solution provides three distinct bypass patterns, adhering to all the constraints outlined in the prompt.",

The focus shifts to Strategy A - targeting the evasion check function before the ExitProcess call. The goal is to find a conditional check related to the exit decision and attempt to bypass it. Three distinct patterns are chosen from the trace, each targeting a different part of the potential evasion logic.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The chosen patterns target a sequence of instructions involved in a potential check before the ExitProcess call. Pattern 0 focuses on the call to a function and subsequent test and conditional jump. Pattern 1 aims to bypass a comparison check before an exit. Pattern 2 targets a memory manipulation sequence that could be part of an evasion check. The use of wildcards allows for flexibility in addressing offsets, increasing the likelihood of bypassing the check without triggering a rule hit.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
