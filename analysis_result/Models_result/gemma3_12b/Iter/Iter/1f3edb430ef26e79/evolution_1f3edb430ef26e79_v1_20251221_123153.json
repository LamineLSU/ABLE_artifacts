      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and craft three bypass patterns.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Suspicious Instructions**\n\nThe trace is complex and involves several calls to `0041EB47h`. This strongly suggests a hook or a check. The `int 9Ch` is also suspicious - it's a breakpoint.  The repeated patterns of `push/mov/call` indicate a possible function pointer table or similar structure.  The exit at `FFD0` (call eax) is the critical point, and likely where the evasion check happens.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Exit Path Backwards**\n\nThe exit occurs at `0041E24F: FFD0 call eax`. This `call eax` is likely executing a function pointer that determines if the execution should continue or terminate (the evasion check). The preceding instructions build up the value in `eax`.\n\n**Step 3: Select Bypass Candidates**\n\nLet's choose three different instructions to bypass:\n\n1.  **`8B 45 10` (MOV EAX, [EBP+10h])**: This instruction loads a value from memory into `eax`.  Bypassing this would prevent the correct function pointer from being loaded.\n2.  **`8B 45 1C` (MOV EAX, [EBP+1Ch])**:  Similar to the above, this loads a value into `eax`.\n3.  **`8B 4D 24` (MOV ECX, [EBP+24h])**: This instruction loads a value from memory into `ECX`.  While not directly influencing `eax`, it's part of a larger pattern and might be related to the check.\n\n**Step 4: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are three patterns, combining the selected instructions with adjacent context.\n\n1.  **Pattern 0 (Bypass `MOV EAX, [EBP+10h]`):**\n    `8B 45 14 50 8B 45 10` (10 bytes) - includes the preceding `MOV EAX, [EBP+14h]` and `PUSH EAX`\n2.  **Pattern 1 (Bypass `MOV EAX, [EBP+1Ch]`):**\n    `51 8B 45 1C 8B 45 28` (10 bytes) - includes the preceding `PUSH ECX` and `MOV EAX, [EBP+28h]`\n3.  **Pattern 2 (Bypass `MOV ECX, [EBP+24h]`):**\n    `8B 45 18 52 8B 4D 24` (10 bytes) - includes the preceding `MOV EAX, [EBP+18h]` and `PUSH EDX`\n\n**Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate the YARA Rule**\n\nNow, let's create the YARA rule, applying wildcards to addresses and offsets.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 45 ?? 50 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 51 8B 45 ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 45 ?? 52 8B 4D ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   The `??` replace the memory addresses in `[EBP+offset]`\n*   The `??` in the patterns represent the memory offsets.\n\nThis rule targets the identified instructions, attempting to bypass the evasion check by skipping those instructions.  The `cape_options` will allow for dynamic bypassing during analysis.  The patterns are within the required 6-20 byte range.\n",
