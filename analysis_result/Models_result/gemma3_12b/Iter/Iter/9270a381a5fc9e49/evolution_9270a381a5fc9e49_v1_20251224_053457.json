The instruction immediately preceding is `FFD0`. This suggests the malware is calling a function pointed to by the value in `eax`.  The code leading up to this `call` is complex and involves pushing values onto the stack and manipulating registers.\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 Bypass Candidates**\n\n1.  **`int3` at `0041E1B0`**: Skipping this would allow execution to continue past a likely breakpoint.\n2.  **`jo 0041E19Bh` at `0041E1ED`**:  Bypassing this conditional jump could alter the execution flow.\n3.  **`call eax` at `0041E21F`**:  This is the exit point, and bypassing it would prevent the malware from calling the function pointed to by `eax`.\n\n**Step 4 & 5: Build Patterns and Apply Wildcards**\n\nHere are the three patterns, adhering to the length and wildcard rules.\n\n**Pattern 0: Bypass `int3`**\n\n```\n8B5514 8B4510 8B4D0C 83C414 52 8B16\n```\n\nThis sequence includes the `int3` instruction and some surrounding context.
