      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt failed to generate new signatures, indicating the rule hit but didn't bypass the evasion. This suggests the rule matched a non-critical location or a common code sequence. To improve, we'll focus on a conditional check before the ExitProcess call (Strategy B), as this is where the decision to exit is made. We'll also include a CALL-TEST-JE sequence (Strategy A) which is often part of evasion checks. The third pattern will target an earlier instruction sequence that contributes to the exit process. The patterns are selected to be specific enough to target the relevant code but generic enough to handle slight variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are extracted directly from the trace and target key instructions involved in the exit process and potential evasion checks. The use of wildcards in the CALL and JMP offsets allows for variations in addresses, increasing the likelihood of bypassing the evasion check without false positives. The inclusion of multiple patterns increases the chances of bypassing the check.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 25 05 00 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 33 FD FF FF 8B CE E8 74 FA FF FF }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B85 F0 FE FF FF 8D8DF8 FE FF FF 03C3 BA 04 01 00 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
