The critical sequence leading to the exit is the `call` instruction at either `0040E7F6` or `0040E7FF` (depending on the trace).  Let's focus on these calls.\n\n**Phase 2 & 3: Counterfactual Hypotheses & Evaluation**\n\nWe'll consider skipping the `call` instructions and the instructions immediately preceding them.\n\n*Counterfactual 1: Skipping the first call (0040E7F6)*\n\n*   Factual: `E8C8FFFFFF       call 0040E7C3h` executes -> ExitProcess\n*   Counterfactual: If skipped ->  Would execution continue? Possibly, but it depends on what `0040E7C3h` does.  We don't know without further analysis, but skipping it *might* allow execution to continue.\n*   Necessity: Likely necessary to prevent exit.\n*   Sufficiency: Unlikely to be sufficient on its own, as the code before this call is also important.\n\n*Counterfactual 2: Skipping the instruction before the first call (0040E7F3)*\n\n*   Factual: `FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` executes ->  leads to `call 0040E7C3h`\n*   Counterfactual: If skipped -> Would execution continue?  Highly unlikely, as this push is likely setting up an argument for the `call`.\n*   Necessity: Not necessary.\n*   Sufficiency: Not sufficient.\n\n*Counterfactual 3: Skipping the second call (0040E7FF)*\n\n*   Factual: `FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` executes -> ExitProcess\n*   Counterfactual: If skipped -> Would execution continue?  Possibly, similar to the first call.  It depends on what's at `0041B0ACh`.\n*   Necessity: Likely necessary to prevent exit.\n*   Sufficiency: Unlikely to be sufficient on its own.\n\n*Counterfactual 4: Skipping the push instruction before the second call (0040E7FC)*\n\n*   Factual: `FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` executes ->  leads to `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`\n*   Counterfactual: If skipped -> Would execution continue?  Highly unlikely, as this push is likely setting up an argument for the `call`.\n*   Necessity: Not necessary.\n*   Sufficiency: Not sufficient.\n\n**Phase 4: Selecting Bypass Points**\n\nBased on the analysis, the most promising bypass points are the `call` instructions themselves. Let's create patterns around these calls, adding some context.\n\n**Phase 5: Building Patterns**\n\nHere are three patterns based on the analysis, following the length and wildcard rules:\n\n**Pattern 1 (Around the first call):**\n\n`E8 C8 FF FF FF 59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00` (18 bytes) - This includes the call itself and the preceding push.\n\n**Pattern 2 (Around the second call):**\n\n`FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00` (22 bytes) - This includes the call itself and the preceding push.\n\n**Pattern 3 (Around the first call, a different set of instructions):**\n\n`8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 E8 C8 FF FF FF` (18 bytes) - This includes the instructions before the first call.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 C8 FF FF FF 59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 E8 C8 FF FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Choices:**\n\n*   **Length:** All patterns are within the 6-20 byte range.\n*   **Wildcards:** No wildcards were needed as all bytes are either addresses, offsets, or opcode bytes.\n*   **Context:** Each pattern includes surrounding instructions to provide context and reduce the likelihood of false positives.\n*   **Different Sequences:** The three patterns are distinct byte sequences.\n*   **Cape Options:** The `cape_options` are set up to skip the matched patterns and provide a count.\n",
