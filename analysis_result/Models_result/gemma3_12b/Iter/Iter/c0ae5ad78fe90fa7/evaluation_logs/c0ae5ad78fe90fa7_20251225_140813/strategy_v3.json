(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and generate bypass patterns following the specified requirements.\n\n**Phase 1 & 2: Adversarial Analysis**\n\n* **Attacker's Perspective:** The malware likely aims to detect virtualization or debugging environments. The `ExitProcess` call suggests the evasion is triggered by a condition met during execution. The calls to `00408FDEh` and `00411064h` are very likely where the checks happen. The push/pop of `[ebp+08h]` hints at passing arguments to these functions.  The `mov edi, edi` is likely a dummy operation.\n\n* **Defender's Perspective:** We need to identify the checks and find ways to bypass them.  Skipping the calls to `00408FDEh` and `00411064h` are the most obvious targets. We could also try to manipulate the arguments passed to those functions.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nBypassing these functions directly is the most straightforward approach. However, a robust malware would likely have checks to see if the return address has been manipulated, or if the call instructions themselves are altered. Therefore, we need to be careful to keep the surrounding code as close to the original as possible.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1. **Bypass the first call (00408FDEh):** This seems like the primary evasion check.\n2. **Bypass the second call (00411064h):**  A second check might exist.\n3. **Skip the push/pop of [ebp+08h] before the second call:** This would prevent arguments from being passed to the second function.\n\n**Phase 5: Pattern Generation**\n\nHere are the patterns, adhering to the length and wildcard rules:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF1564104100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 55 8BEC FF7508 FF1564104100 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** `8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59` - This bypasses the first `call 00408FDEh`. It combines the preceding instructions up to the `call` instruction, including a few following instructions for context. The `E8C8FFFFFF` is a call offset, so it's marked as `??` in the pattern.\n*   **$pattern1:** `FF7508 FF1564104100` - This bypasses the second `call dword ptr [00411064h]`.  It's a short sequence focusing on the call instruction.\n*   **$pattern2:** `55 8BEC FF7508 FF1564104100` - This bypasses the second `call` while also skipping the push/pop of `[ebp+08h]`.  This pattern is different from the others and targets a slightly different evasion behavior.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Context:** These bypasses are based on the limited trace provided. The actual evasion logic might be more complex.\n*   **Robustness:**  A real-world malware would likely include checks to detect these types of bypasses.\n*   **Functionality:** These bypasses might break legitimate functionality if the malware uses these checks for other purposes.\n*   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):**  The addresses used in the bypasses might be different in a real-world scenario due to ASLR.\n*   **Further Analysis:**  A more thorough analysis would involve disassembling the called functions (`00408FDEh` and `00411064h`) to understand the evasion checks.\n",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`. CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.
