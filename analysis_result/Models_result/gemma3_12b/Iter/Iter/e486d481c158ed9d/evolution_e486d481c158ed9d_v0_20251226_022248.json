Given the error history and the \"Failed to deploy YARA rule\" message, we'll focus on simpler patterns extracted directly from the trace. We'll use Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) and avoid complex skip logic. The goal is to find a basic pattern that triggers a rule hit and then refine it in subsequent iterations. We'll select patterns that appear around the exit process calls and include wildcards for addresses to increase flexibility.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 60\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are taken directly from the trace and target instructions surrounding the `ExitProcess` calls. The use of wildcards for offsets aims to bypass specific checks while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy. The `CAPE_OPTIONS` will be initially set to skip, but this may be adjusted in future iterations. The patterns are designed to hit the target area without introducing overly complex logic that could cause deployment errors.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 8B EC 83 EC ?? 53 56 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 8B 45 FC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
