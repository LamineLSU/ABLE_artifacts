This is a common stack manipulation technique often used in evasion. The `E8 25 05 00 00` is a relative jump, so it's replaced with `??` as it's an address.\n*   **$pattern1:** `8D 95 F0 FE FF FF 89 9D F0 FE FF FF 8B CE E8 74 FA FF FF`\n    *   This pattern captures `lea edx, [ebp-0x110]; mov dword ptr [ebp-0x110], ebx; mov ecx, esi; call 01205C17`.  This sequence looks like it's setting up a hidden data structure. The `E8 74 FA FF FF` is a relative jump and is replaced with `??`.\n*   **$pattern2:** `FF 15 88 A0 20 01 FF 15 2C A1 20 01 33 FF 8B C7`\n    *   This pattern captures `call dword ptr [0120A088]; call dword ptr [0120A12Ch]; xor edi, edi; mov eax, edi`.  This is a call to an indirect address, a common evasion tactic.\n\n**Rationale for Wildcards:**\n\n*   The offsets in the `call` instructions (`E8 25 05 00 00` and `E8 74 FA FF FF`) are crucial to the malware's functionality and vary between traces.  Replacing them with `??` allows the rule to match similar sequences even if the specific jump addresses are different.\n*   Addresses stored in memory (e.g., `[0120A088h]`) are also replaced with `??` to account for variations in those addresses.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Testing:** This rule is a starting point. Thoroughly test it against a wider range of samples and traces to ensure it effectively bypasses evasion while minimizing false positives.\n*   **Adaptation:** Malware authors can easily change these patterns. Regularly update the YARA rule to stay ahead of new evasion techniques.\n*   **Specificity:** If the rule generates too many false positives, consider adding more specific conditions or refining the patterns.\n*   **CAPE Integration:**  The `cape_options` meta-tag is set up for integration with Cuckoo Sandbox or similar platforms.  The `bp` (breakpoint) settings specify where the execution should be skipped, and `action` defines the action to take.\n",
