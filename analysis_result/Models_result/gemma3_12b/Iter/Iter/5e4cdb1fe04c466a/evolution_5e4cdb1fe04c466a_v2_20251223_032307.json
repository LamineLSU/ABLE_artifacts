      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and craft some bypass patterns based on the provided guidelines. The key here seems to be the `call eax` instruction at `0041E30F`, which is causing the early exit. We need to find a point where we can skip or alter this instruction without disrupting the overall flow too much.  I'll focus on instructions leading up to this call.\n\n**Analysis & Hypothesis Generation**\n\nThe trace shows a complex sequence of instructions before the `call eax`. The `call eax` is likely the culprit, as it's the final instruction before the exit. The preceding instructions manipulate registers and stack, likely preparing arguments for the function called via `eax`. The function call itself is the likely evasion trigger.\n\n**Bypass Patterns**\n\nHere are three potential bypass patterns, focusing on disrupting the `call eax` sequence. I'll prioritize patterns that involve relatively straightforward modifications and have a decent chance of bypassing the evasion check.\n\n**Pattern 1 (Targeting the `push edx` instruction)**\n\nThis pattern aims to skip the `push edx` instruction, effectively removing one of the arguments being passed to the function. This might prevent the function from executing correctly or triggering the evasion mechanism.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Pattern 1\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B16 50 51 FF D2 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `52`: push edx\n*   `8B16`: mov edx, dword ptr [esi]\n*   `50`: push eax\n*   `51`: push ecx\n*   `FF D2`: call edx\n\nThis pattern is 11 bytes long. Skipping the `push edx` will likely prevent the function call from executing correctly.\n\n**Pattern 2 (Targeting the `call 0041EC07h` instruction)**\n\nThis pattern aims to skip the call to `0041EC07h`. This might alter the state of the registers and stack, leading to a different `eax` value at the time of the final `call eax` instruction.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Pattern 2\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 56 6A 36 6A 00 51 8DB0 A0 0C 00 00 56 50 E8 74 0A 00 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `56`: push esi\n*   `6A 36`: push 0x36\n*   `6A 00`: push 0x00\n*   `51`: push ecx\n*   `8DB0 A0 0C 00 00`: lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000CA0h]\n*   `56`: push esi\n*   `50`: push eax\n*   `E8 74 0A 00 00`: call 0041EC07h\n\nThis pattern is 16 bytes long. Skipping the call might change the execution flow significantly.\n\n**Pattern 3 (Targeting the `or al, 8Bh` instruction)**\n\nThis pattern aims to skip the `or al, 8Bh` instruction. This might alter the value of AL, which could influence a later conditional jump or other operation.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Pattern 3\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0C 8B 8B 06 6 83 C4 14 83 C4 14 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `0C`: or al, 8Bh\n*   `8B`: mov eax, dword ptr [esi]\n*   `6`: push es\n*   `83 C4 14`: add esp, 14h\n*   `83 C4 14`: add esp, 14h\n\nThis pattern is 11 bytes long. Skipping the `or al, 8Bh` might prevent a conditional jump from being taken.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Trace Specificity:** These patterns are derived directly from the provided trace. They might not be effective against variations of the malware.\n*   **Evasion Logic:** The exact evasion mechanism is unknown. These patterns are educated guesses based on common evasion techniques.\n*   **Testing:**  These patterns *must* be tested in a sandbox environment to verify their effectiveness.\n*   **Context:** The effectiveness of these bypasses will depend on the surrounding code and the overall malware behavior.\n*   **Wildcards:** I've minimized wildcards to keep the patterns as precise as possible.  More wildcards would increase the likelihood of a match but decrease the effectiveness of the bypass.\n\n\n\nI believe these three patterns provide a good starting point for bypassing the evasion. Remember to test them thoroughly and adjust them as needed based on the sandbox results.",
