Since the original trace shows a `call` instruction to `0040E7C3h`, that's a good place to start.  The `8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08` pattern appears to be leading up to this call.

I'll target instruction sequences that appear to be part of an evasion check or conditional logic before the `ExitProcess` call.
