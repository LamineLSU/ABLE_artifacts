This is likely a call to a function that triggers the sandbox/VM exit.  Let's trace back and look for potential checks. The `and dword ptr [ebp-1Ch], 00000000h` instruction might be a check against a flag. The `call 00406805h` followed by `call 004067EBh` seems like a custom function call chain that might be involved in the evasion logic.\n\n**TRACE #2 Analysis:**\n\nSimilar to Trace #1, this trace also ends with a `call dword ptr [0A15A16Ch]`.  The conditional jump `cmp eax, 01h` and `je 0A14EC76h` is a key check.  The `mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]` instruction likely accesses a process-specific data structure, and the subsequent `shr eax, 08h` and `test al, 01h` seems to be checking a bit in that structure. This is a common technique for detecting virtualization.\n\n**Bypass Candidates and Patterns:**\n\nHere are three different bypass candidates, along with the corresponding patterns:\n\n**1. Bypass Candidate: Conditional Jump (Trace #2)**\n\nThe `cmp eax, 01h` instruction and subsequent `je 0A14EC76h` are crucial for the evasion. If we bypass this check, the execution flow will change.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_ConditionalJump\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass conditional jump check\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 51 8B F8 55 8B EC 83 F8 01 74 20 } //push ecx, mov edi, edi, push ebp, mov ebp, esp, cmp eax, 01h, je 0A14EC76h\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**2. Bypass Candidate:  Function Call (Trace #1)**\n\nThe `call 00406805h` is a function call that might be part of the evasion logic. Bypassing it might change the execution flow.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_FunctionCall\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass function call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8D 45 B8 50 56 FF 15 C0 A0 41 00 E8 47 00 00 00 } // lea eax, dword ptr [ebp-48h], push eax, push esi, call dword ptr [0041A0C0h], call 00406805h\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**3. Bypass Candidate:  Memory Access (Trace #2)**\n\nThe `mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]` instruction accesses a process-specific data structure.  This is likely a key indicator for virtualization detection. Bypassing this might prevent the evasion.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_MemoryAccess\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass memory access\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 64 A1 30 00 00 00 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01 } // mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h], mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h], shr eax, 08h, test al, 01h\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   The `je` instruction's offset is replaced with `??` in the first pattern.\n*   The address of the function being called in the second pattern is replaced with `??`.\n*   The memory address in `fs:[00000030h]` is replaced with `??` in the third pattern.\n\nThese patterns are designed to be specific enough to target the evasion logic while being flexible enough to account for minor variations. They are also within the 6-20 byte length requirement.\n",
