(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the traces and craft some bypass patterns following the provided guidelines.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nBased on the trace data, the malware appears to be attempting to detect a virtualized/sandboxed environment.  The presence of `ExitProcess` at the end of both traces strongly suggests this. The calls to `[0041A0BCh]`, `[0041A0C0h]`, `[0041A244h]`, `[0041A228h]`, `[0A15A114h]`, `[0A15A118h]`, `[0A15A16Ch]` likely contain the actual evasion checks. These calls probably perform checks related to:\n\n*   **Process Environment:** Checking for specific processes or DLLs loaded.\n*   **System Information:** Verifying hardware/software configuration.\n*   **Timing/Behavior:** Detecting rapid execution or unusual patterns.\n*   **Memory Inspection:**  Detecting debugging or memory analysis tools.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nWe need to identify points where skipping an instruction could disrupt the evasion logic without causing the malware to crash. The goal is to bypass the checks without triggering a false positive.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nAny bypass is likely to be detectable by a sophisticated attacker.  The key is to find points that are less likely to be immediately flagged as suspicious.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 Different Bypass Points**\n\nHere are 3 bypass points, along with reasoning:\n\n1.  **Trace #1: `004067B3  FF15C0A04100     call dword ptr [0041A0C0h]`**: This is a prime candidate. It's an indirect call, likely to a function containing an evasion check. Skipping this will bypass the check.\n2.  **Trace #2: `0A14EC66  FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`**: This push instruction is followed by a call. If we can bypass the `push`, we might be able to avoid a check based on the value on the stack.\n3.  **Trace #1: `004067D7  51               push ecx`**: This push instruction is followed by a call. If we can bypass the `push`, we might be able to avoid a check based on the value in ECX.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 8BEC 83EC48 56 FF15C0A04100 }  //Trace #1, Bypass call to [0041A0C0h]\n        $pattern1 = { 0A14EC4A 55 8BEC E8BB210000 83F801 7420 }  //Trace #2, Bypass push instruction\n        $pattern2 = { 004067D6 51 51 E85A290100 }  //Trace #1, Bypass push instruction\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** This pattern includes the preceding instructions to provide context for the `call`. The `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `sub esp, 48h`, `push esi` are included to give context.\n*   **$pattern1:** This pattern includes the preceding instructions to provide context for the `push`. The `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `E8BB210000`, `83F801`, `7420` are included to give context.\n*   **$pattern2:** This pattern includes the preceding instructions to provide context for the `push`. The `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `E85A290100` are included to give context.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   These bypasses are likely to be detected by a sophisticated malware analysis environment.\n*   The effectiveness of these bypasses may vary depending on the specific evasion techniques used by the malware.\n*   Further analysis and experimentation may be required to identify more robust bypasses.\n*   The inclusion of context instructions helps avoid triggering new signatures.\n\nThis provides a solid starting point for bypassing the evasion. Remember to test these patterns in a controlled environment and iterate based on the results.",

      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the traces and construct three YARA bypass patterns based on the provided requirements.\n\n**TRACE #1 Analysis:**\n\nThe trace ends with a `call dword ptr [0041A228h]`. This is likely a call to a function that triggers the sandbox/VM exit.  Let's trace back and look for potential checks. The `and dword ptr [ebp-1Ch], 00000000h` instruction might be a check against a flag. The `call 00406805h` followed by `call 004067EBh` seems like a custom function call chain that might be involved in the evasion logic.\n\n**TRACE #2 Analysis:**\n\nSimilar to Trace #1, this trace also ends with a `call dword ptr [0A15A16Ch]`.  The conditional jump `cmp eax, 01h` and `je 0A14EC76h` is a key check.  The `mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]` instruction likely accesses a process-specific data structure, and the subsequent `shr eax, 08h` and `test al, 01h` seems to be checking a bit in that structure. This is a common technique for detecting virtualization.\n\n**Bypass Candidates and Patterns:**\n\nHere are three different bypass candidates, along with the corresponding patterns:\n\n**1. Bypass Candidate: Conditional Jump (Trace #2)**\n\nThe `cmp eax, 01h` instruction and subsequent `je 0A14EC76h` are crucial for the evasion.

do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.
