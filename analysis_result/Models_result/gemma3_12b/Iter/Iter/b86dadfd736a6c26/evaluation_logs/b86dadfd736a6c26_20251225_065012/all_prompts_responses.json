      "response_text": "Okay, let's break down this malware evasion bypass analysis and generate the required YARA rules.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe code snippet appears to be a rudimentary check for a virtualized environment or debugging. The `div ecx` followed by `cmp edx, 05h` and the loop back to `jmp 004109C5h` suggest a division operation with a constant divisor, likely checking for timing discrepancies or other artifacts common in virtual machines. The `call 00410930h` might be another check or a cleanup routine. The final `call 00410B14h` is probably the exit point.  The `mov ecx, 0x0Ah` implies that `ecx` is the divisor.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nThe division check is a key point of interest. If we can manipulate the result of the division or bypass the comparison, we might be able to continue execution. The loop back to `004109C5h` makes it a particularly effective evasion technique.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nA simple bypass might involve altering the value of `ecx` or `edx` before the `div` instruction. However, that would require more complex manipulation. Skipping the comparison (`jne 004109DAh`) is a more direct approach.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\nHere are three bypass points I've selected, along with reasoning:\n\n1. **Skip the comparison:** `cmp edx, 05h` -  If the comparison fails, the loop is exited, and the `call 00410930h` is executed.  Bypassing this means the loop is skipped and the program continues.\n2. **Skip the division:** `div ecx` - If the division is skipped, the `cmp edx, 05h` instruction will operate on an unpredictable value, and the check will likely fail.\n3. **Skip the loop back:** `jmp 004109C5h` - This is a less targeted bypass, but could be effective if the other checks are robust.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nNow, let's create the YARA patterns, keeping the length and wildcard rules in mind.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 33D2 83FA05 7502 EB02 } // Skip division, comparison and loop back\n        $pattern1 = { F7F1 83FA05 7502 } // Skip division and comparison\n        $pattern2 = { 83FA05 7502 EB02 } // Skip comparison and loop back\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** This pattern combines the `div ecx`, `cmp edx, 05h`, `jne` and `jmp` instructions.  This bypass is more aggressive, skipping a larger chunk of code.\n*   **$pattern1:**  This pattern skips only the `div ecx` and `cmp edx, 05h` instructions, which might be less disruptive than skipping the entire loop.\n*   **$pattern2:** This pattern skips the `cmp edx, 05h` and the `jmp` instruction, bypassing the loop condition.\n\n**Rationale for Wildcards:**\n\nNo wildcards are needed in this case because there are no addresses or offsets in these specific instructions. The goal is to skip the checks entirely, not to modify their behavior.\n",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.
