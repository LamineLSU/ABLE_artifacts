The strategy shifts to focus on identifying conditional checks *before* the `ExitProcess` call, as these are more likely to represent evasion logic. We'll examine the trace for patterns indicative of conditional logic related to the exit. We will also prioritize patterns near the exit call to improve precision.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns target instructions directly involved in the decision-making process before the exit, focusing on conditional jumps and tests. The use of wildcards for offsets allows for flexibility in addressing variations in the target environment.
