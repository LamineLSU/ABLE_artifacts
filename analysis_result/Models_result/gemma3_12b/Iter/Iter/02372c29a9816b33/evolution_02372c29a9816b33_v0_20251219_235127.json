This indicates the rule is too specific and needs to be broadened while still hitting the correct location. The strategy is to focus on the check before the exit, specifically the `test eax, eax` followed by a conditional jump. We're using three distinct patterns from the trace to cover different variations of this check. `CAPE_OPTIONS` are included as requested. We're using wildcards for addresses to allow for slight variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target the check before the exit. The `test eax, eax` followed by a conditional jump is a common pattern for checks. By using wildcards for addresses, we allow for variations in the code while still targeting the correct general sequence.
