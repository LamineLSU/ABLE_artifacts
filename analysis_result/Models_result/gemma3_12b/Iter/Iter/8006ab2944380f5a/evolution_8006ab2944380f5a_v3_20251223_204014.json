      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and generate bypass patterns following the provided guidelines.\n\n**Phase 1 & 2: Adversarial Analysis & Identification of Evasion Checks**\n\nThe trace strongly suggests a delay execution technique, likely attempting to detect if it's running in a virtualized environment or a debugger. The repeated calls to `0041F233h` with different pushes and `lea` instructions are likely part of this detection. These calls are likely performing checks on system state, timing, or memory layout. The final `call eax` at `0041E93B` is likely the critical point where the malware exits if evasion checks fail.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nThe attacker is likely looking for characteristics of a virtual machine or debugger.  The `lea` instructions combined with pushes suggest that the malware is examining the stack or other memory regions to see if they are consistent with a normal environment.  The `call eax` is the final decision point; if the checks performed by `0041F233h` indicate a sandbox, the malware exits.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 Different Bypass Points**\n\n1.  **Target `0041E8C0 FFD2` (call edx):**  This call likely performs a check, and bypassing it could prevent the malware from recognizing a virtualized environment.\n2.  **Target `0041E92D E824130000` (call 0041F233h):** This call is repeated and central to the evasion. Skipping it is likely to prevent the evasion check from happening at all.\n3.  **Target `0041E93B FFD0` (call eax):** This is the exit point. If we can bypass the checks leading to this call, we can force execution to continue.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the 3 bypass patterns, formatted as requested, with wildcards applied appropriately.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3 }\n        $pattern1 = { 56 6A36 6A00 51 8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B550C 8B06 83C414 52 55 8B4508 8B88D8020000 56 6A36 6A00 51 8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000 8B550C 8B06 83C414 52 FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** `52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3` (Bypass `call edx`): This pattern includes the `push edx`, `mov edx, dword ptr [esi]`, `push eax`, `push ecx`, `call edx`, `pop esi`, `pop ebp`, `ret` instructions. Skipping this sequence would bypass the check performed by the `call edx`.\n*   **$pattern1:** `56 6A36 6A00 51 8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000` (Bypass `call 0041F233h`): This pattern includes the `push esi`, `push 00000036h`, `push 00000000h`, `push ecx`, `lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000AA8h]`, `push esi`, `push eax`, `call 0041F233h` instructions. Skipping this would prevent the evasion check from running.\n*   **$pattern2:** `8B550C 8B06 83C414 52 55 8B4508 8B88D8020000 56 6A36 6A00 51 8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000 8B550C 8B06 83C414 52 FF` (Bypass `call eax`): This pattern combines several instructions from around the exit point. This is a more aggressive bypass and may require further refinement. The `FF` at the end is to include the next instruction for context.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Testing:** These patterns *must* be tested in a controlled environment to ensure they achieve the desired bypass effect without causing unintended consequences.\n*   **Specificity:**  These patterns are designed to be relatively specific, but malware authors can easily modify their code to evade them.\n*   **Robustness:** Malware authors often employ multiple evasion techniques. These bypasses might only address one aspect of the evasion.\n*   **Context:** The surrounding code and the behavior of `0041F233h` are crucial for understanding the full evasion strategy. A more complete analysis may reveal more effective bypass points.\n*   **CAPE Options:** The `cape_options` are configured to skip these instructions, which should force execution to continue past the evasion check.\n",
