The feedback suggests focusing on a general characteristic of the bypassed code, specifically targeting the `call 0094667Fh` instruction and the API call it makes.  Instead of focusing on sequential skipping, I am targeting specific instruction sequences found in the trace that are likely part of the evasion logic. I am incorporating three distinct patterns from the trace, each focusing on different aspects of the execution flow around the `call 0094667Fh`.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns are chosen based on their proximity to the `call 0094667Fh` instruction and their representation of common evasion techniques.
