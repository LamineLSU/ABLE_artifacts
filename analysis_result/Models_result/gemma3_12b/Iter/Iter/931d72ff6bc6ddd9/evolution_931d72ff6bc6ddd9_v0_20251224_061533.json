      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts resulted in rule hits without new signatures, indicating that the rule was matching the correct area but not effectively bypassing the evasion. This suggests that the initial patterns were too specific and not accounting for potential variations in the evasion logic. Therefore, I'm shifting focus to Strategy A (Evasion Check), attempting to target the check function itself rather than the exit. I'm selecting patterns that appear to be part of the conditional logic preceding the `ExitProcess` call. The patterns have been selected to be slightly more general using wildcards for offsets where appropriate, while still remaining rooted in the trace data.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The selected patterns are designed to target the conditional checks before the exit. By targeting these checks, the goal is to disrupt the evasion logic and allow the execution to proceed beyond the intended bypass point. The wildcards are included to allow for some flexibility in the offsets.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
