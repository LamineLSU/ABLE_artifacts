The core issue was likely the reliance on specific offsets and the use of `cape_options`, which constrained the rule's ability to adapt to variations in the obfuscation logic. This evolution focuses on broadening the patterns to include more wildcards to accommodate these variations and removing the `cape_options` entirely.
