We need to target a more critical point in the evasion logic, likely a conditional check before the `ExitProcess` call.  I'm focusing on patterns found near the `ExitProcess` call in the trace, specifically looking for conditional jumps and API calls that might be part of the evasion mechanism. I'm also adding more specific patterns to avoid false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are extracted directly from the trace and target key instructions surrounding the `ExitProcess` call. The first pattern targets a common check-and-jump sequence. The second targets a specific API call sequence. The third targets a conditional jump. The use of concrete bytes minimizes the chance of false positives, while wildcards allow for slight variations in addresses.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 85 F0 FE FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
