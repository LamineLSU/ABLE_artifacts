The focus shifts to targeting a conditional check before the ExitProcess call, based on Strategy B. We'll also include a test-je sequence from Strategy A. The final pattern is a common comparison-jump sequence. This approach prioritizes finding the decision point before the exit rather than the exit itself.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns target specific sequences found in the trace related to the exit process and conditional checks. Using concrete bytes from the trace minimizes false positives and focuses the rule on the core evasion logic. Wildcards are used for offsets to allow for variations in addresses. The inclusion of a test-je sequence provides another potential bypass point.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 25 05 00 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 33 FD FF FF 8B CE }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
