This seems to be a core part of the evasion logic. The `ExitProcess` call is the termination point, which is what we want to bypass. Let's target these early checks.\n\n**Pattern 1: Target the initial conditional jump**\n\nThis pattern targets the first conditional jump in each trace, which seems to be the primary check for the evasion. We'll include the `test eax, eax` and the `je` instruction.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - Initial conditional jump\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern 2: Target the CALL instruction to 011D667F (or similar)**\n\nThis pattern targets the `CALL` instruction that's frequently present, likely involved in the evasion logic.  We will include the preceding `push` and `pop` instructions as context.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - CALL instruction\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern 3: Target the CALL instruction to 011D1680 (or similar)**\n\nThis pattern targets another `CALL` instruction that appears in all traces.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - CALL instruction 2\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 50 E8 E3 FA FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards and Pattern Choices**\n\n*   **Pattern 1:** The `74` instruction is a jump and has an offset. We replace the offset with `??` because we don't know the exact address it should jump to.\n*   **Pattern 2:** The `E8` instruction is a CALL instruction, and the 4 bytes following it are the relative address.  We replace those with `??`.\n*   **Pattern 3:** The `E8` instruction is a CALL instruction, and the 4 bytes following it are the relative address.  We replace those with `??`.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   These are initial bypass attempts. Further refinement may be needed based on sandbox behavior.\n*   The `cape_options` are set to skip the pattern. Adjust as needed.\n*   The \"count=0\" parameter in cape_options is important for avoiding excessive skips.\n*   The addresses in the `CALL` instructions will likely vary between traces, so using `??` is essential.\n*   These patterns target different points in the evasion logic.
