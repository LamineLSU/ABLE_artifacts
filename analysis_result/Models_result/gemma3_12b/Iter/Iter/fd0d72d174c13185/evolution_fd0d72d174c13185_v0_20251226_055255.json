Given the 'Failed to deploy YARA rule' error, I'm prioritizing simple, concrete patterns from the trace to ensure a deployable rule. I'm focusing on Strategy A (Evasion Check) initially, targeting sequences around the `test eax, eax` and conditional jumps. I'm selecting patterns that are present near the ExitProcess call, aiming to bypass the check before the exit. I will choose 3 distinct sequences of bytes from the trace to ensure a more targeted bypass and avoid false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 60\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are directly extracted from the trace and represent a sequence of instructions involved in an evasion check. The `test eax, eax` followed by a conditional jump is a common pattern for checking conditions before executing a function. The use of wildcards in the jump offset allows for flexibility in the exact offset. The `cape_options` are included to facilitate skipping these sections of code during analysis.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8D 95 F0 FE FFFF 89 9D F0 FE FFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
