Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n7. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "prompt_tokens": 1178,
        "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and construct three bypass patterns following the specified rules.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Suspicious Instructions**\n\nThe trace contains several conditional jumps, calls, and pushes/pops that likely contribute to the evasion. The `ExitProcess` call at the end suggests the malware is trying to terminate. The repeated `cmp ax, 0001h` and `call 039F8F1Dh` sequences are particularly interesting, as they likely represent checks for a virtualized environment.  The calls to addresses like `03A15180h`, `03A15138h`, `03A150C4h`, and `03A1517Ch` are also likely critical, potentially checking for VM characteristics.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Exit Path Backwards**\n\nThe execution terminates at `FF153451A103     call dword ptr [03A15134h]`. The preceding instruction, `039F9410  6A00             push 00000000h`, pushes a zero onto the stack. This is probably being used as an argument to the function called by `03A15134h`.  The conditional jumps (`jne`) leading up to this point are key to the evasion logic.\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 Different Bypass Candidates**\n\nHere are three candidate bypass points:\n\n1.  **`039F93C2  6683F801         cmp ax, 0001h`**:  This comparison is likely a core check. Skipping it could bypass the VM detection.\n2.  **`039F93D8  FF158051A103     call dword ptr [03A15180h]`**: This call could be part of the VM detection.\n3.  **`039F93F3  68E8030000       push 000003E8h`**: This push is probably used as a parameter for a function call.\n\n**Step 4: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the patterns, combining instructions and adhering to the length requirement:\n\n1.  **Pattern 0 (Bypassing the `cmp` instruction):**\n    `6683F801 7520 6683F801` (11 bytes) - This sequence includes the comparison instruction and the `JNE` that follows it.\n2.  **Pattern 1 (Bypassing the `call` instruction):**\n    `FF158051A103 EBF3 68E8030000` (15 bytes) - This includes the call instruction and the jump instruction that follows it.\n3.  **Pattern 2 (Bypassing the `push` instruction):**\n    `68E8030000 FF158051A103 EBF3` (15 bytes) - This includes the push instruction and the jump instruction that follows it.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate the YARA Rule**\n\nNow, let's create the YARA rule with wildcards for addresses and offsets.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 66 83 F8 01 75 ?? 66 83 F8 01 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 15 80 51 A1 03 EB F3 68 E8 03 00 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 68 E8 03 00 00 FF 15 80 51 A1 03 EB F3 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   The `75 ??` in pattern0 replaces the jump offset.\n*   No other wildcards were needed as the addresses are not present in these short sequences.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   This is a starting point. The effectiveness of these bypasses depends on the specific VM detection techniques used by the malware.\n*   The `cape_options` are set to skip the matched bytes. This is a common approach to bypass detection.\n*   The rule is designed to be specific, but further refinement might be necessary based on testing and observation.  It is critical to test these rules in a controlled environment.\n* The YARA rule is designed to be easily adaptable for testing purposes.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

The analysis suggests targeting the entire loop responsible for the evasion technique, specifically focusing on the `call dword ptr [03A15134h]` instruction at `039F9412` and the preceding stack manipulation.
