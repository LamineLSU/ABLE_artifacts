      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and craft three bypass patterns. The malware exits at `0041E24F` with `FFD0` (call eax).  This indicates a conditional call based on the value in `eax`.  The code leading up to this call is suspicious, involving stack manipulation, pushing values, and calls to `0041EB47`.  We need to identify a point where we can alter `eax` or the execution flow to bypass this check.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Identifying Suspicious Instructions & Tracing Backwards**\n\nThe `call eax` at `0041E24F` is the critical point. The code preceding it builds up the value in `eax` from a value stored in memory pointed to by `esi`.  The `lea esi` instructions are likely calculating the memory address. The `push` instructions before the `call` suggest arguments being prepared for the function called via `eax`.  The `call 0041EB47` is also suspicious as it could be performing checks or modifications.\n\n**Step 3: Bypass Candidates**\n\n1. **`push 00000000h` at `0041E236`**:  If we could change this to `push` a non-zero value, it might change the value in `eax` and thus the call target.\n2. **`lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000CA0h]` at `0041E239`**: This instruction calculates the address used to fetch the value for `eax`. Altering `eax` here could lead to a different memory location being read, potentially bypassing the check.\n3. **`call 0041EB47h` at `0041E241`**: This call could be performing the evasion check. Bypassing it entirely might be a straightforward solution.\n\n**Step 4: Pattern Construction**\n\nHere are three patterns based on the above candidates, adhering to the length requirement and wildcard rules.\n\n**Pattern 1: Modifying the push argument**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Pattern1\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass by modifying push argument\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 00 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  This pattern replaces the `push 00000000h` at `0041E236` with `push 0000005A`. The `5A` is just a placeholder. The surrounding instructions are included to provide context.\n\n**Pattern 2: Altering the `lea` calculation**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Pattern2\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass by modifying the LEA calculation\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8DB0 A0 0C 00 00 56 56 50 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This pattern skips the `lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000CA0h]` and the subsequent `push esi` instructions.  The `E8` instruction represents a call, and its offset is replaced with `??`.\n\n**Pattern 3: Skipping the `call 0041EB47h`**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Pattern3\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass by skipping the call to 0041EB47\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 56 56 6A 36 6A 00 51 51 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  This pattern skips the `call 0041EB47h` instruction and the preceding `push` instructions. The `E8` instruction represents a call, and its offset is replaced with `??`.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   These patterns are based on a limited trace.  The actual evasion might be more complex.\n*   The effectiveness of these bypasses depends on the specific implementation of the evasion mechanism.\n*   The `cape_options` are placeholders and need to be adjusted based on the specific sandbox/VM environment.\n*   The `0041EB47` call could be a critical part of the program's functionality. Skipping it might cause unexpected behavior.\n*   The `push 0000005A` in the first pattern is just an example.  A more sophisticated analysis might be needed to determine the correct value to push.\n",
