The key is to identify suspicious evasion points and construct patterns that target them precisely.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the observed behavior and potential evasion points, followed by the YARA rule.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Early Exit:** Both traces terminate at `0041E24F` with `FFD0` (call eax). This suggests a conditional check that leads to an early exit.  The `call eax` is likely the trigger for the early exit.  The `eax` register likely contains an address that is being checked.\n*   **Stack Manipulation:** The code heavily manipulates the stack, pushing and popping registers and values.\n*   **Instruction Duplication:**  Many instructions are duplicated. This is likely done to obfuscate the real functionality of the code.\n\n**Potential Evasion Points & Pattern Selection:**\n\n1.  **The `call eax` instruction:** This is the immediate termination point, making it a prime target. We need to capture the context leading up to it.\n2.  **Stack Setup:** The push operations (`push 00000036h`, `push 00000000h`, etc.) followed by the `lea` instruction are suspicious.\n3.  **`sbb byte ptr [edx-1374AAFEh], cl`:**  This instruction is unusual and could be related to an anti-analysis check.\n\n**YARA Rule:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 36 6A 00 51 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 56 56 6A 36 6A 00 51 51 }\n        $pattern2 = { 18 8A 02 55 8BEC 8B 45 08 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`$pattern0`:**  Captures the push operations and the call instruction before the exit. The `??` wildcard represents the displacement of the `call` instruction, as it's an address.\n*   **`$pattern1`:** Captures the repeated `push` and `push` instructions.\n*   **`$pattern2`:** Captures the `sbb` instruction and the following instructions, which may be related to anti-analysis checks.\n\n**Rationale for Wildcard Usage:**\n\n*   The `E8` opcode (call) is followed by a displacement, which is crucial to the functionality.  Replacing this with `??` allows the rule to match even if the target address changes.\n*   Addresses are used as offsets.  Wildcards are used to make the rule more general.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Testing:** This rule is a starting point.  Thorough testing is essential to ensure it bypasses the evasion mechanism without causing unintended consequences.\n*   **Specificity:** The patterns are designed to be reasonably specific, but further refinement might be needed based on testing results.\n*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Dynamic analysis (e.g., debugging) can provide valuable insights into the malware's behavior and help identify more precise evasion points.\n*   **Trace Variations:**  The \"Total Traces\" being 2 is very small. The rule needs to be adapted if the trace varies significantly between executions.\n",
