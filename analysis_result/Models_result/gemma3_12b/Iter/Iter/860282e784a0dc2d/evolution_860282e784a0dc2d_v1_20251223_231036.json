The analysis suggests removing the `CAPE_OPTIONS` and focusing on common sequences. We'll focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting instructions related to conditional checks before the exit call. The chosen patterns are concrete sequences extracted directly from the trace, aiming to be specific enough to bypass the check without crashing.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are directly extracted from the trace and target key instructions before the `ExitProcess` calls. The first pattern looks for a `test eax` followed by a conditional jump, common in evasion checks. The second focuses on an instruction before the second `ExitProcess` call. The third pattern targets a comparison instruction that could be part of a conditional logic leading to the exit. Using concrete bytes increases specificity and reduces the chance of false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
