This suggests the patterns were too specific and needed to be broadened to account for variations in the execution flow.

The wildcards are used to accommodate potential variations in offsets and immediate values within these checks. The first pattern focuses on a common test/jump sequence. The second targets a comparison followed by a jump. The third pattern attempts to catch a more generic conditional jump.
