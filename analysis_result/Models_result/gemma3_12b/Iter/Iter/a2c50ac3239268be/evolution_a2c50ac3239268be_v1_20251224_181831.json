The trace reveals a common pattern of conditional checks before the `ExitProcess` call.  We will focus on bypassing these checks using concrete instruction sequences from the trace. I've chosen three distinct patterns, prioritizing those that appear near the beginning of the trace and involve conditional jumps or comparisons. The `cape_options` will be included as requested, although given the duplication of instructions, aggressively skipping may not be necessary.  The goal is to find a pattern that effectively skips the check, allowing the program to continue execution past the intended bypass point.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target specific instructions involved in the decision-making process before the exit, aiming to disrupt the evasion logic. The inclusion of wildcards for offset addresses allows for flexibility in matching similar code sequences across different samples.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 3D 00 C0 4A 00 00 83 3D 00 C0 4A 00 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 76 09 83 3D 00 C0 4A 00 00 74 1C }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 7B 10 85 FF 74 1C }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
