The analysis suggests focusing on a key functionality and creating a signature around it. I've chosen to focus on a conditional check before a function call, as this often represents a decision point that could be bypassed. I am also including a pattern related to a call to a function with an argument. These patterns are designed to be more resilient to minor code variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are derived directly from the trace and target a conditional check and a function call, which are likely critical parts of the malware's logic. The use of wildcards allows for some flexibility in the exact addresses, making the rule more robust.
