      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and generate the requested YARA patterns for bypassing the evasion.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe malware appears to be checking for a virtualized/sandboxed environment. The `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h` instruction is suspicious. This is likely comparing the value on the stack with a specific value (07E4h) which could be a known value associated with a specific sandbox or VM environment.  If the value doesn't match, the malware exits. The repeated `call 00406BA8h` with `push 00000000h` further suggests a check or timing mechanism.  The comparison `cmp ebx, 80000001h` is likely another check.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nThe most promising bypass points are:\n\n*   **`cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h`**: If we could manipulate the value on the stack at this point to match 07E4h, the malware would continue. However, directly manipulating the stack is complex. Skipping the instruction is simpler.\n*   **`cmp ebx, 80000001h`**: Similar to above, altering `ebx` to 80000001h would allow the malware to continue. Skipping this instruction would also bypass the check.\n*   **`call 00406BA8h`**: This call seems to be performing some kind of check.  Skipping it might disrupt the evasion logic.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSkipping instructions is a relatively simple bypass. The attacker would likely notice this change in execution flow but a simple check is easier to bypass than a more complex one.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1.  `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h`\n2.  `cmp ebx, 80000001h`\n3.  `call 00406BA8h`\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the YARA patterns, constructed according to the requirements:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83C4F0 8BD8 54 E8B0C8F9FF 66813C24E407 }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A00 E86B25FEFF 81FB01000080 0F94C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A00 E86B25FEFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** This pattern targets the `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h` instruction. The pattern includes the preceding `add esp, FFFFFFF0h`, `mov ebx, eax`, `push esp`, and `call 00406968h` to provide context. The `66813C24E407` is the instruction in question.\n*   **$pattern1:** This pattern targets the `cmp ebx, 80000001h` instruction. It includes the preceding `push 00000000h`, `call 00406BA8h`, and `push 00000000h`.\n*   **$pattern2:** This pattern targets the `call 00406BA8h` instruction, used for another check. It includes `push 00000000h` to provide context.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   These patterns are designed to be specific to the provided trace.  Slight variations in the malware code could render them ineffective.\n*   The `cape_options` are set to skip the targeted instructions.\n*   The length of the patterns is within the 6-20 byte requirement.\n*   The wildcards are not needed in these patterns because all addresses and offsets are fixed in the provided trace.\n*   The attacker could easily detect this bypass by observing the altered execution flow. More sophisticated evasion techniques would be required for a truly robust bypass.\n",

      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and construct the YARA rules.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Suspicious Instructions**\n\nThe trace contains several instructions that could be part of an evasion check. The most obvious are:\n\n*   `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h` - Comparison of ESP value. This is likely checking for a specific environment.\n*   `sete al` - Sets AL if the previous CMP instruction resulted in equal.\n*   `cmp ebx, 80000001h` - Comparison of EBX value. Another environment check.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Exit Path Backwards**\n\nThe exit occurs at `0046A0C2`.  The code jumps to `0046A0C2` based on the result of the `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h` instruction. If the comparison fails (not equal), the code jumps to `0046A0C0`.  The `sete al` instruction is crucial, setting AL based on the `cmp` result.  The `cmp ebx, 80000001h` also appears to be part of an evasion check.\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 Different Bypass Candidates**\n\nBased on the analysis, let's select these three bypass candidates:\n\n1.  `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h` (The initial environment check)\n2.  `sete al` (The flag setting based on the environment check)\n3.  `cmp ebx, 80000001h` (The second environment check)\n\n**Step 4: Build Patterns**\n\nNow, let's create patterns for each candidate, combining them with adjacent instructions.\n\n1.  **Pattern 1 (Bypassing `cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h`):**\n    `83C4F0 8BD8 54 E8B0C8F9FF` (add esp, FFFFFFF0h + mov ebx, eax + push esp + call 00406968h) - 16 bytes\n\n2.  **Pattern 2 (Bypassing `sete al`):**\n    `0F94C0 8BD8 6A00 E86B25FEFF` (sete al + mov ebx, eax + push 00000000h + call 00406BA8h) - 16 bytes\n\n3.  **Pattern 3 (Bypassing `cmp ebx, 80000001h`):**\n    `6A00 E86B25FEFF 8BC3 83C410` (push 00000000h + call 00406BA8h + mov eax, ebx + add esp, 10h) - 16 bytes\n\n**Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate the YARA Rule**\n\nNow, let's create the YARA rule with the patterns and wildcards.  Addresses and offsets need to be replaced with `??`.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 C4 F0 8B ?? ?? 54 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 0F 94 C0 8B ?? ?? 6A 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B C3 83 C4 10 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   `$pattern0`: The `E8` instruction (call) contains an offset, so we replace the bytes with `??`.\n*   `$pattern1`: The `E8` instruction (call) contains an offset, so we replace the bytes with `??`.\n*   `$pattern2`: The `E8` instruction (call) contains an offset, so we replace the bytes with `??`.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   The wildcarded YARA rule is designed to be more general and will match similar code patterns.  More specific rules can be created if more information about the target is available.\n*   The `cape_options` meta tag allows the YARA rule to be used with Cuckoo Sandbox or other similar platforms. The `bp` (breakpoint) and `action` values specify where to insert breakpoints and what action to take (in this case, skipping the instruction).\n*   The patterns are chosen to be relatively short and cover the core logic of the evasion check.\n*   These patterns are based solely on the provided trace data. The effectiveness of these bypasses will depend on the specific malware and its evasion techniques.\n",

Perhaps targeting a different, more unique part of the code block could be more reliable.\n\n\n## Original Trace\nSHA256: 564d7870a1507925ab8383d6614abb87cc89bf0cd482964c60e3e85b03d30fca\nSource: check_for_time_delay_via_gettickcount.xlsx\nTotal Traces: 1\n================================================================================\n\nTRACE #1 - ExitProcess at 0046A0C2\n----------------------------------------\n    0046A0AC  53               push ebx\n    0046A0AD  83C4F0           add esp, FFFFFFF0h\n    0046A0B0  8BD8             mov ebx, eax\n    0046A0B2  54               push esp\n    0046A0B3  E8B0C8F9FF       call 00406968h\n    0046A0B8  66813C24E407     cmp word ptr [esp], 07E4h\n    0046A0BE  7307             jnc 0046A0C7h\n    0046A0C0  6A00             push 00000000h\n>>> 0046A0C2  E8D1C7F9FF       call 00406898h\n    0046A0C7  6A00             push 00000000h\n    0046A0D1  E86B25FEFF       call 00406BA8h\n    0046A0D6  81FB01000080     cmp ebx, 80000001h\n    0046A0DC  0F94C0           sete al\n    0046A0DF  8BD8             mov ebx, eax\n    0046A0E1  6A00             push 00000000h\n    0046A0EB  E86B25FEFF       call 00406BA8h\n    0046A0F0  8BC3             mov eax, ebx\n    0046A0F2  83C410           add esp, 10h\n    0046A0F5  5B               pop ebx\n    0046A0F6  C3               ret \n\n## Evolution Task\n\nBased on the feedback, generate an IMPROVED YARA bypass rule.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n1. Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt resulted in a rule hit but no new signatures, indicating the pattern matched the wrong location. We need to shift the focus earlier in the trace and target the evasion check itself. Strategy A (Evasion Check) is prioritized. I've identified three distinct patterns from the trace that appear to be part of a conditional check before the exit. These patterns are concrete to minimize false positives. The `cape_options` are included to skip the matched instructions, attempting to bypass the evasion logic.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns were selected because they represent a conditional check sequence that likely contributes to the evasion mechanism.  The concrete nature of the patterns should reduce the likelihood of false positives.

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt resulted in a rule hit with no new signatures, indicating the rule matched the wrong location within the trace. The analysis suggests adjusting the `skip` offset or focusing on conditional logic before the exit. I'm prioritizing Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by selecting patterns that target conditional checks before the exit call. I\u2019m focusing on patterns near the exit process call, looking for conditional jumps that might control the program flow.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns are designed to target the conditional jump instructions (JE/JNE) that likely control the exit process. By targeting these instructions, the bypass should redirect execution flow, avoiding the original intended behavior. The patterns are specific enough to minimize false positives but also include wildcards for address offsets to account for potential variations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 00 E8 B0 C8 F9 FF 6A 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A 00 E8 6B 25 FE FF 8BC3 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

We will also include an API check and CMP_SETZ pattern.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The chosen patterns are designed to target a conditional check before the exit, which is a common evasion technique. The `CALL` followed by `TEST` and conditional jump sequence is a likely candidate for an evasion check. The API check targets a call to a specific API. The CMP_SETZ pattern targets a comparison followed by a conditional jump, common in control flow.  The use of concrete bytes minimizes the risk of false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83C4F0 8BD8 54 E8B0C8F9FF }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A00 E8D1C7F9FF }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A00 E86B25FEFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
