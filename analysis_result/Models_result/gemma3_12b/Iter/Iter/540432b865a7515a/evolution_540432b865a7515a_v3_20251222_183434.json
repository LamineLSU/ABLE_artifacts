      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous rule hit but found no new signatures, indicating it matched the wrong location or bypassed the wrong logic. The analysis suggests broadening the patterns and skipping larger blocks of code. I'm focusing on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) to target the check function and conditional logic before the exit. I've chosen three distinct patterns from the trace, focusing on sequences involving conditional jumps and memory access, to increase the likelihood of bypassing the intended logic. The goal is to move earlier in the trace and target the decision-making process rather than the exit action itself.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are derived directly from the trace and target key instruction sequences that likely contribute to the evasion check or conditional exit. The use of wildcards allows for some variation in addresses and offsets, increasing the chances of bypassing the intended logic while maintaining specificity.  The patterns target test/je sequences and conditional checks before the exit, which are prime candidates for evasion checks.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
