We need to refine the bypass to target a decision point related to the ExitProcess call, rather than the call itself. This evolution focuses on Strategy A - targeting the check function before the ExitProcess, specifically a test followed by a conditional jump. I've chosen three different sequences that appear before the ExitProcess call and might represent checks that influence the execution path.  The patterns are designed to be more specific than previous attempts by using concrete bytes where possible.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are located before the `ExitProcess` call and involve checks that likely control the execution flow. The `test eax, eax` followed by `je` instructions are common conditional checks. By targeting these, we aim to bypass the decision-making process that leads to the `ExitProcess` call.
