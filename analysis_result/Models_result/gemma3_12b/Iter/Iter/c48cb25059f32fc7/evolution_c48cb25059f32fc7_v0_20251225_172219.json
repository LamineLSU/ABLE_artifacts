We need to focus on identifying the decision point before the ExitProcess call. Strategy A (Evasion Check) will be prioritized. We'll examine the trace for conditional jumps or checks related to the exit. The goal is to find a pattern that, if bypassed, would prevent the exit from occurring.  Three distinct patterns will be selected from the trace and used as bypass points to skip over the checks.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns were chosen because they represent conditional checks that likely influence the exit process. The use of wildcards for address offsets allows for flexibility while maintaining specificity.
