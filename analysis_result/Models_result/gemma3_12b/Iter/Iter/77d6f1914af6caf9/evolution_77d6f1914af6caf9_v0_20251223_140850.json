This implies the rule was either too specific and incorrectly targeted a critical instruction, or too general and interfered with the analysis process. We'll focus on Strategy A, targeting evasion checks before the ExitProcess call, and attempt to bypass the logic that leads to the exit. We will also introduce some variations to see if we can find a more robust bypass. The patterns are chosen to represent common checks before termination, including comparisons and conditional jumps.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 60\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are based on instructions found directly in the trace, specifically around the ExitProcess call. The `test eax, eax` followed by a conditional jump is a common pattern for checking a value before proceeding. The first pattern focuses on this, while the second attempts to bypass a comparison check. The third pattern aims to disrupt a conditional jump.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
