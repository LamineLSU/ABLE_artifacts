(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided trace data and generate the requested YARA rule with three distinct bypass patterns.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe malware likely checks for a virtualized or sandboxed environment. The `ExitProcess` calls in both traces suggest an evasion mechanism. The key differences between the traces are the `call` instructions at `00405823` and `0040582C`. The first uses `E8C8FFFFFF` which calls `004057F0`. The second uses `FF151CE04000` which calls a memory address. This suggests a check based on a memory location.  If this memory location has a certain value, the malware exits. The `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` before each `call` suggests a parameter being passed to the check function.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nThe decision points are the `call` instructions.  If we can prevent these calls from executing, we might bypass the evasion. The fact that the second call uses a memory address makes it potentially more susceptible to manipulation.  If the memory location being checked is directly accessible, we could modify its value. Skipping the `call` itself is a simpler approach.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSimply skipping the `call` is a robust bypass. The attacker would likely need to re-implement the check or change the memory address being checked.  It's relatively specific, so it's unlikely to break legitimate functionality.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1.  **Skip the first `call` (00405823):**  This is a straightforward bypass.\n2.  **Skip the second `call` (0040582C):**  This bypass targets the memory address-based check.\n3.  **Skip the `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` before the second `call` (00405829):**  This bypass attempts to prevent the parameter from being passed to the check function.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the YARA patterns, adhering to the specified rules.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }  // Skip first call (11 bytes)\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 59 FF7508 FF151CE04000 } // Skip second call (16 bytes)\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 FF7508 } // Skip push before second call (14 bytes)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:** This pattern skips the first `call` instruction. It includes the preceding instructions for context.\n*   **$pattern1:** This pattern skips the second `call` instruction. It includes the preceding instructions for context.\n*   **$pattern2:** This pattern skips the `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` before the second `call`.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   These patterns are based on the provided trace data. Variations in the malware's code might require adjustments.\n*   The effectiveness of these bypasses depends on the specific implementation of the evasion check.\n*   The `cape_options` meta tag is included for compatibility with tools like Cuckoo Sandbox. The `skip` action tells the sandbox to skip the matched instruction. The `count=0` means the bypass will not increment the bypass count.\n*   These bypasses might trigger other anti-analysis techniques. Further investigation might be required to achieve a complete bypass.\n",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`. CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.
