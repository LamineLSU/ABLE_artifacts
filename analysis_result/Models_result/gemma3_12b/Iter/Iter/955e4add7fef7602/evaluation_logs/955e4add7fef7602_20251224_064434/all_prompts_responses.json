Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n7. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",
      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided trace data and construct three bypass patterns according to the given requirements.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Suspicious Instructions**\n\nThe most suspicious instructions are the `CALL` instructions and the preceding instructions that might control their execution. The `ExitProcess` calls are the ultimate exit point, so we need to figure out what's leading to them.  We'll focus on the code leading up to the `ExitProcess` calls.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Exit Path Backwards**\n\n*   **TRACE #1:**  `ExitProcess` at `0040E7F6`.  The call at `0040E7F6` is `E8C8FFFFFF`, which is a relative call to `0040E7C3`.  The preceding `mov edi, edi` and `push ebp` are standard prologue instructions. The `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` is also interesting as it pushes a value from the stack.\n*   **TRACE #2:** `ExitProcess` at `0040E7FF`.  The call at `0040E7FF` is `FF15ACB04100`, which is an indirect call through a memory location. The preceding instructions are similar to Trace #1.\n\n**Step 3: Select Bypass Candidates**\n\nBased on the trace, let's select the following instructions for bypass attempts:\n\n1.  `E8C8FFFFFF` (Call to 0040E7C3h) - This call is present in both traces.\n2.  `FF15ACB04100` (Indirect Call) - This call is only present in Trace #2.\n3.  `FF7508` (Push dword ptr [ebp+08h]) - This push is present in both traces.\n\n**Step 4: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the three patterns, combining instructions for context and meeting the length requirement:\n\n1.  **Pattern 1 (Bypassing the direct call):**  `55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF` (Push EBP, Mov EBP, Push [EBP+8], Call 0040E7C3) - 11 bytes\n2.  **Pattern 2 (Bypassing the indirect call):** `FF7508 FF15ACB04100` (Push [EBP+8], Indirect Call) - 7 bytes\n3.  **Pattern 3 (Bypassing the stack push):** `FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF` (Push [EBP+8], Call 0040E7C3) - 7 bytes\n\n**Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate YARA Rule**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 8BEC FF7508 E8?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF15?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 E8?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   In `$pattern0`, the offset in `E8C8FFFFFF` is replaced with `??` since it's a relative jump/call offset.\n*   In `$pattern1`, the memory address in the indirect call is replaced with `??`.\n*   In `$pattern2`, the offset in `E8??` is replaced with `??`.\n*   The other bytes are kept concrete as they are likely opcodes or register-encoding bytes.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   These patterns are based on a limited trace.  More context might be needed for a more accurate bypass.\n*   The `cape_options` are included as requested.\n*   The `condition: any of them` means that any of the three patterns being matched will trigger the rule.\n*   This is a starting point; further refinement might be necessary depending on the actual behavior of the malware.\n*   The patterns are different sequences of bytes.\n*   All patterns are within the 6-20 byte length constraint.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt resulted in a rule hit but no new signatures, indicating the pattern was too broad or matched the wrong location. The focus shifts to Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting the conditional checks before the ExitProcess call. I'm selecting patterns that appear to be part of a conditional logic block preceding the ExitProcess call, specifically looking for instructions that might be involved in an evasion check. I've prioritized concrete bytes where possible to increase specificity and reduce false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target instruction sequences observed before the ExitProcess call, aiming to bypass an evasion check. The use of concrete bytes minimizes the chance of matching incorrect locations, while the wildcards allow for some variation in the surrounding bytes.

Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous rule hit but found no new signatures, indicating it matched a location that wasn't the actual evasion check or decision point. We need to move earlier in the trace and focus on potential conditional checks before the `ExitProcess` calls. I'm trying Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting instructions before the calls to `ExitProcess`. I'm selecting patterns that look like conditional jumps or checks related to a decision-making process.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns target instructions that appear to be part of a conditional check before the `ExitProcess` calls. Pattern 0 targets a `test` instruction followed by a conditional jump, a common pattern for evasion checks. Pattern 1 targets a `cmp` instruction followed by a conditional jump. Pattern 2 focuses on a comparison and jump sequence as well.
