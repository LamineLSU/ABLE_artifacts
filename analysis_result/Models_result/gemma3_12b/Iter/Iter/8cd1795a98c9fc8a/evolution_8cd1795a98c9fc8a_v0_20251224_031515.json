Use a debugger to trace the execution and determine the correct offset to skip to the next relevant instruction.

A more robust approach is to not use skip offsets at all, and instead use a more generic pattern that captures the overall behavior, or use a more sophisticated analysis technique that dynamically adapts to the code flow."
