Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",
      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace data and generate three bypass patterns according to the provided requirements.\n\n**Phase 1 & 2 (Establish factual outcome & Generate hypotheses):**\n\nThe program exits via `ExitProcess`. The immediate cause seems to be either the `call 0040E7C3h` (Trace 1) or the `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` (Trace 2).  Since these are different calls in the two traces, it suggests a conditional execution path based on some environmental factor.  The `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` is the most likely trigger, as it's indirect and likely resolving an address dynamically, making it more susceptible to sandbox interference.\n\n**Phase 3 (Evaluate Hypotheses):**\n\nLet's consider some counterfactuals.\n\n* **Counterfactual 1: `E8C8FFFFFF` (call 0040E7C3h) - Trace 1:**  If this call were skipped, the program would likely continue.  It's a necessity, but not sufficient because Trace 2 does something else.\n* **Counterfactual 2: `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]) - Trace 2:** If this call were skipped, the program would likely continue. This is the most promising candidate as it's the differentiating factor between the two traces.\n* **Counterfactual 3: `FF7508` (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]) - Both Traces:** Skipping this would change the state of the stack, but it's less likely to be the primary evasion trigger.\n\n**Phase 4 (Select Bypass Points):**\n\nBased on the above, we'll target the `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` in Trace 2. We will also include the preceding `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` to provide context.\n\n**Phase 5 (Build Patterns):**\n\nHere are three patterns, formatted according to the instructions.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 55 8B EC FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **`$pattern0`**:  This pattern targets the `push` and `call` instructions from Trace 2.\n*   **`$pattern1`**: This pattern includes the `push ebp` and `mov ebp, esp` instructions preceding the `push` and `call` from Trace 2.\n*   **`$pattern2`**: This pattern includes the `mov edi, edi` and `push ebp` instructions preceding the `push` and `call` from Trace 2.\n\nThese patterns cover the critical execution path in Trace 2 and provide enough context to avoid accidental matches in other code.  The `??` wildcards are not needed here as all bytes are concrete.\n",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt resulted in a rule hit with no new signatures, indicating that the pattern matched the wrong location. We need to shift the focus earlier in the trace to target a decision-making point before the exit call. Strategy A (Evasion Check) will be prioritized. We'll look for a `CALL` instruction followed by a `TEST EAX` and a conditional jump (`JE` or `JNE`).  We will also attempt to find a conditional check before the exit using Strategy B.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: Focusing on the early trace, we've identified a sequence that appears to be a check before the `ExitProcess` call. The `TEST EAX` followed by a conditional jump is a strong indicator of an evasion check.  The wildcards are used for the jump destination, as it's likely to vary. The other patterns are designed to find other potential conditional checks before the exit.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83F80174128B4D}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace data and craft three YARA bypass patterns.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Suspicious Instructions**\n\n*   `CALL 0040E7C3h` (Trace 1) & `CALL 0040E7C3h` (Trace 2): This call is likely a check or some evasion logic.\n*   `FF15ACB04100 call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` (Trace 2): This indirect call is highly suspicious, potentially resolving an address from memory for execution.  This is a key candidate.\n*   `E8C8FFFFFF` (Trace 1 & 2): Relative jump instruction.  The offset is important.\n*   The ExitProcess calls themselves are points of interest.\n\n**Step 2: Trace the Exit Path Backwards**\n\nThe exit point is `ExitProcess`. We'll focus on the differing exit points in the two traces.\n\n*   **Trace 1:** Exits at `0040E7F6`.  The last instruction is `E8C8FFFFFF call 0040E7C3h`.  This `call` likely handles the evasion check.\n*   **Trace 2:** Exits at `0040E7FF`. The last instruction is `FF15ACB04100 call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`. This indirect call is a likely evasion mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 Different Bypass Candidates**\n\n1.  **`CALL 0040E7C3h` (Trace 1):**  Bypassing this call might allow execution to continue past the evasion check.\n2.  **`FF15ACB04100 call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` (Trace 2):**  Bypassing this indirect call could prevent the malware from resolving and executing a potentially malicious address from memory.\n3.  **`E8C8FFFFFF` (Both traces):** Modifying or skipping this jump could alter the execution flow and potentially bypass the evasion.\n\n**Step 4: Build Patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\n1.  **Pattern 1 (CALL 0040E7C3h):**  `E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508` (11 bytes) This pattern includes the call and the surrounding instructions.\n2.  **Pattern 2 (FF15ACB04100):** `FF7508 FF15ACB04100 59` (12 bytes) This pattern includes the `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` instruction, the indirect call, and the `pop ecx`.\n3.  **Pattern 3 (E8C8FFFFFF):** `FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 55` (11 bytes) This pattern includes the `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`, the relative jump, and the `push ebp`.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate the YARA Rule**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8??FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF15??ACB04100 59 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 E8??FFFFFF 55 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n**Explanation of Wildcards:**\n\n*   In `$pattern0`, `??` replaces the jump offset in `E8??FFFFFF`.\n*   In `$pattern1`, `??` replaces the address in the memory-resolved call `FF15??ACB04100`.\n*   In `$pattern2`, `??` replaces the jump offset in `E8??FFFFFF`.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This is a starting point. The effectiveness of these bypasses depends heavily on the specific evasion mechanism.\n*   The `cape_options` are placeholders. You'll need to adjust them based on your specific testing environment.\n*   Further analysis of `0040E7C3h` and the memory address at `0041B0ACh` would be necessary for a more targeted bypass.\n*   The malware might be using more complex evasion techniques that are not apparent from this short trace.\n",

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

      "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and generate the YARA rule with three bypass patterns, following all the provided guidelines.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe malware likely aims to detect virtual machines or sandboxes. The `ExitProcess` call is a strong indicator of evasion.  The checks likely involve looking for specific characteristics of these environments (e.g., timing anomalies, missing hardware, specific software installed). The calls to `0040E7C3` and `0041B0AC` are likely the evasion checks themselves.  The differing call targets in the two traces suggests a conditional check, possibly based on system state.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nWe can manipulate the execution flow to prevent the malware from reaching the evasion checks. Skipping either call would likely defeat the evasion.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSimple skips are likely to be detected by more sophisticated evasion techniques. However, for initial bypass, simple skips are the easiest.\n\n**Phase 4: Bypass Points**\n\nHere are three bypass points:\n\n1.  **Skip `call 0040E7C3h` in Trace 1:** This avoids the first evasion check.\n2.  **Skip `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` in Trace 2:** This avoids the second evasion check.\n3.  **Skip the entire prologue:** This avoids *all* checks, potentially the most robust but also most disruptive.\n\n**Phase 5: Pattern Generation**\n\nNow, let's build the YARA patterns.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 } // Skip call 0040E7C3h\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF15ACB04100 } // Skip call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 } // Skip prologue\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **`$pattern0`**:  Includes the instructions leading up to the first `call`. This is 13 bytes long.\n*   **`$pattern1`**: Includes the instructions leading up to the second `call`. This is 8 bytes long.\n*   **`$pattern2`**: Includes the first few instructions of the prologue. This is 8 bytes long.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThese patterns are relatively short and focused on the key decision points. The surrounding instructions provide context, reducing the likelihood of false positives. The bypasses are straightforward skips, which are easy to implement but might be detectable by more advanced malware. The `cape_options` meta tag is set up to be used with Cuckoo Sandbox or similar tools for automated testing.\n",

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt resulted in a rule hit with no new signatures, indicating that the rule matched a portion of the code but not the intended evasion check.  We need to shift focus to earlier parts of the trace and look for conditional checks before the exit call. Strategy A (Evasion Check) is prioritized, followed by Strategy B (Exit Decision). We'll focus on patterns that appear to be decision-making logic.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The chosen patterns target instructions involved in what seems to be a conditional check before the `ExitProcess` call.  The `cmp` instruction followed by a conditional jump is a common pattern for decision-making. The first pattern specifically targets the comparison of a value against a register, which could be part of an evasion check. The second pattern targets a push/call sequence, potentially related to a function call that performs a check. The third pattern focuses on a `mov` instruction followed by a jump, which is also indicative of conditional logic. The use of wildcards for offsets allows for some flexibility while maintaining specificity.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern1 = { 55 8B EC 83 EC 10 53 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 45 FC 83 F8 01 74 12 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n7. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern.
