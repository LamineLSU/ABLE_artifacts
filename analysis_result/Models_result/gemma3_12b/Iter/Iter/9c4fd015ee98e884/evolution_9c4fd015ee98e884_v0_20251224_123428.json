The most practical solution is to broaden the YARA rule to detect the presence of the `ExitProcess` call sequence itself, rather than attempting to bypass it.  This allows for detection without attempting a potentially unstable bypass.  Alternatively, a more complex YARA rule with conditional logic could be developed, but this would require a deeper understanding of the malware's behavior."
