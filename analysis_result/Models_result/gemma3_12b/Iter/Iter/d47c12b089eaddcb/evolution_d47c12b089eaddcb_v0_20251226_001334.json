This evolution focuses on simpler, more concrete patterns extracted directly from the trace, targeting potential evasion checks before the `ExitProcess` calls. We're prioritizing Strategy A (Evasion Check) initially, targeting the first 30% of the trace. The patterns chosen are intended to be distinctive while accounting for potential variations in addresses using wildcards.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are derived directly from the trace and target a common evasion pattern: a call followed by a test of a register (likely EAX) and a conditional jump. The wildcards are used for offsets, which are likely to vary between samples.  The increased confidence reflects the use of concrete bytes from the trace and a focus on a common evasion technique.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
