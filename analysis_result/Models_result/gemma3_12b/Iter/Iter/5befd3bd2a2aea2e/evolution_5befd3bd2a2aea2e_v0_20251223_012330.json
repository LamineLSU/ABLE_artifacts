Instead of skipping, the goal should be to identify the key instruction sequence that represents the bypass technique.  The `CAPE_OPTIONS` should be removed entirely as they're not contributing to the rule's effectiveness and are likely the cause of the crashes."

We'll focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by examining earlier instructions that might be part of an evasion check before the ExitProcess calls.  We'll target specific instruction sequences that look like conditional checks, looking for a test instruction followed by a conditional jump. The patterns are chosen to be specific enough to avoid false positives but generic enough to cover variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target what appears to be a conditional check before the ExitProcess calls, which is a likely location for an evasion check. The `test eax` followed by `je` is a common pattern for checking if a function has been hooked or if a certain condition is met before exiting. The `cmp eax, imm32` also suggests a conditional check.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
