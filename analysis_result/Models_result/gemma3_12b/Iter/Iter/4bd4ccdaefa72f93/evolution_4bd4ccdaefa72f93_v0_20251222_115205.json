This iteration aims to create a rule based on the provided trace, focusing on a conditional check before the exit call. The rule will use three distinct patterns extracted from the trace, targeting a `cmp eax, imm32 + jb` sequence, a conditional jump based on `rax`, and a call instruction.  Wildcards are used to represent addresses and offsets that might vary.  The `cape_options` are included to facilitate skipping over the matched regions.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 60\n\n**REASONING**: These evolved patterns are derived directly from the provided trace and target key decision points before the exit. The `cmp eax, imm32 + jb` sequence is a common conditional check. The conditional jump based on `rax` likely controls the execution flow. The call instruction represents a function call that may be part of the evasion logic. The wildcards allow for slight variations in these sequences without breaking the bypass.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern1 = { 4883F8FF 74 4E }\n        $pattern2 = { FF15B20E0000 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
