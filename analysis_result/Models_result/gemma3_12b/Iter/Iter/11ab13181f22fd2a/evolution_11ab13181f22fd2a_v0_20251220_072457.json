This suggests the matched portion wasn't the crucial decision point. We'll try targeting a sequence involving a conditional jump after a test instruction, a common pattern in evasion checks. We'll also include a pattern before the exit to check if a condition controls the exit itself. Finally, we'll include a third pattern that looks like a check involving a comparison. All patterns are taken directly from the provided trace and are concrete except for the addresses which are replaced by wildcards.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: Targeting the `test eax, eax; je` sequence is a common approach to bypassing checks that rely on register values. The pattern before the exit call attempts to identify and bypass a conditional check that might control the exit process. The third pattern focuses on a comparison instruction, which is frequently used for evasion.
