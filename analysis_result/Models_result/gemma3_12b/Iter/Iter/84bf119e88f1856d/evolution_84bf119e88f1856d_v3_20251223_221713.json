The analysis suggested introducing wildcards and reconsidering the skip strategy. Given that the rule hit, it means we're close to the evasion logic. We will focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision), looking for conditional checks before the exit. We will extract three distinct patterns from the trace, incorporating wildcards for addresses and offsets. The goal is to bypass the check without altering the exit process itself.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are extracted directly from the trace, focusing on the instructions leading up to the ExitProcess call. Wildcards are used for addresses and offsets to account for potential variations. The inclusion of conditional jumps (JE/JNE) suggests a check being performed before the exit.
