      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace data and craft three YARA bypass patterns following the specified rules.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Identify Suspicious Instructions & Trace Exit Path**\n\nThe malware exits via `ExitProcess`.  We need to understand what led to this. The trace shows two slightly different exit points, but the core logic is similar. Let's focus on the first trace.\n\nThe exit occurs at `0040E7F6` (call 0040E7C3h) and `0040E7FF` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]).  The call at `0040E7FF` seems more likely to be the direct trigger, as it's a call through a pointer, which is a common evasion technique.  It's possible that the pointer points to `ExitProcess` itself, or a function that ultimately calls it.\n\nLet's consider the instructions leading up to `0040E7FF`:\n\n* `0040E7FC: FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`\n* `0040E7FF: FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`\n\nThe `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` likely pushes an argument to the function called at `0041B0ACh`.  The fact that it's loaded from the stack (ebp+08h) suggests a dynamic or indirect argument.\n\n**Step 3: Bypass Candidates**\n\nBased on the above, here are three bypass candidates:\n\n1. **`push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` (0040E7FC):**  Skipping this would prevent the argument from being pushed, potentially causing the called function to fail or behave differently.\n2. **`call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` (0040E7FF):**  This is the most direct evasion point.  If we could bypass this call, the malware would likely not exit.\n3. **`E8C8FFFFFF       call 0040E7C3h` (0040E7F6):** This call seems to be part of the setup for the next instruction, potentially preparing the argument.\n\n**Step 4 & 5: Build Patterns and Apply Wildcards**\n\nHere are the three patterns, adhering to the length requirement and wildcard rules.\n\n**Pattern 0: Bypass `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`**\n\n`8B FF 55 8BEC FF7508` (11 bytes)\n\n* `8B FF`: mov edi, edi (unrelated, but part of the sequence)\n* `55`: push ebp\n* `8BEC`: mov ebp, esp\n* `FF7508`: push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n\n**Pattern 1: Bypass `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`**\n\n`FF7508 FF15ACB04100` (10 bytes)\n\n* `FF7508`: push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n* `FF15ACB04100`: call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n\n**Pattern 2: Bypass `call 0040E7C3h`**\n\n`59 FF7508 FF15ACB04100` (11 bytes)\n\n* `59`: pop ecx\n* `FF7508`: push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n* `FF15ACB04100`: call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n\n**Step 6: YARA Rule**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B FF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 59 FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n",

Given the analysis, we need to shift focus to earlier points in the trace, specifically targeting potential evasion checks before the exit. We'll use Strategy A (Evasion Check) and focus on identifying checks followed by conditional jumps. We'll also include a second potential check before the exit and a third pattern targeting a specific API call. All patterns are taken directly from the provided trace to avoid false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target key areas before the exit process. The first pattern attempts to bypass a check involving a test instruction and conditional jump. The second pattern targets the API call to avoid detection. The third pattern targets a comparison instruction, potentially another evasion check.
