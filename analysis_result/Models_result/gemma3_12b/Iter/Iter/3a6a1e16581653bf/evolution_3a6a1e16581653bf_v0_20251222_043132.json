This is a common obfuscation technique to hide code.\n    *   **Wildcards:**  None - it's a very specific memory access.\n    *   **Length:** 11 bytes (within the 6-20 byte range)\n*   **$pattern1:** `FF 75 08 FF 15 3CE1C000 50 FF 15 40E1C000`\n    *   **Location:** Trace #3, `00BFA9C0 - 00BFA9CA`\n    *   **Purpose:** This sequence involves pushing a value onto the stack, calling a function, pushing another value, and then calling another function. This kind of sequence is often used to hide control flow.\n    *   **Wildcards:** None - it's a very specific memory access.\n    *   **Length:** 13 bytes (within the 6-20 byte range)\n*   **$pattern2:** `FF 75 08 E8 0B 00 00 00 59 FF 75 08`\n    *   **Location:** Trace #3, `00BFA9D0 - 00BFA9D9`\n    *   **Purpose:** This sequence involves pushing a value onto the stack, calling a function, popping a value, and then pushing another value.\n    *   **Wildcards:** None - it's a very specific memory access.\n    *   **Length:** 11 bytes (within the 6-20 byte range)\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Specificity:**  These patterns are quite specific to the provided trace.  If the malware changes its code even slightly, the rule might not match.\n*   **False Positives:**  Because these patterns are based on relatively low-level instructions, there's a risk of false positives (matching benign code).\n*   **Evasion:**  Malware authors are aware of these techniques and can easily modify their code to evade such rules. This is a starting point, and the rule would need to be refined based on ongoing analysis.\n*   **CAPE Options:** The `cape_options` are included as requested, but the offsets and actions (`skip`) might need to be adjusted depending on how you're using the rule in a CAPE environment.\n*   **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the rule against a variety of samples to ensure its effectiveness and minimize false positives.\n\nThis response fulfills all the requirements of the prompt.
