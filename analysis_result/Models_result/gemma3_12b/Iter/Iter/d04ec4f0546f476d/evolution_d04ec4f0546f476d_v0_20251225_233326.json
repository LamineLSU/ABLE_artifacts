We're shifting to Strategy A (Evasion Check) and focusing on a sequence of instructions that precedes the call to `[003A6148h]`. The chosen patterns aim to capture a common conditional check pattern often used in evasion techniques. We're avoiding wildcards where possible to improve specificity and reduce false positives. The `cape_options` are included for debugging and further refinement.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target a conditional check sequence (CMP, TEST, JE/JNE) which is often used to determine whether to proceed with the evasion logic. By targeting this sequence, we hope to bypass the check and allow the program to continue execution. The specific offsets and concrete bytes were selected from the trace to maximize accuracy.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B FF 55 8B EC 83 F8 01 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 75 08 50 FF 15 14613A00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
