The trace shows a combination of instruction manipulation, conditional jumps, and calls to other routines.  The `ExitProcess` at `0041E24F` suggests a termination on detection.  The frequent use of `push` and `pop` indicates potential stack manipulation. The calls to `0041EB47h` suggest a core function that might be related to the evasion check.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSeveral points seem promising for bypass.  Skipping instructions around conditional jumps and calls is often effective. The `CALL eax` at `0041E24F` is a critical point; if this is the final check, skipping it should bypass the evasion.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1.  **Bypass `CALL eax` at `0041E24F`**: This is the most likely final check.\n2.  **Bypass Conditional Jump `JNP 0041E251h` at `0041E1DB`**: This jump is directly after a potential check.\n3.  **Bypass `CALL 0041EB47h` at `0041E1FE`**: This call is repeated multiple times, suggesting a core component of the evasion check.\n\n**Phase 5: Pattern Building**\n\nNow, let's construct the YARA patterns.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B550C 8B06 83C414 52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3 }  // Bypass CALL eax at 0041E24F (15 bytes)\n        $pattern1 = { 7B74 F0B661 57 C01323 C9 83C255 55 8BEC 8B4508 8B4814 56 56 6A35 6A00 }  // Bypass JNP at 0041E1DB (19 bytes)\n        $pattern2 = { 56 6A36 6A00 51 8DB0A00C0000 56 50 E8740A0000 }  // Bypass CALL 0041EB47h at 0041E1FE (17 bytes)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0**: Skips the `CALL eax` at `0041E24F` and its preceding instructions.
