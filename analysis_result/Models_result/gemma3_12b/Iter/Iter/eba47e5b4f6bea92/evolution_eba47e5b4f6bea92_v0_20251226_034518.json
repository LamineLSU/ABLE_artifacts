This iteration focuses on simpler, more robust patterns derived directly from the trace, targeting common evasion checks before the `ExitProcess` call. The `cape_options` are included as requested, and the patterns are designed to be less reliant on specific addresses and more focused on the general instruction sequences. I've chosen patterns that appear to be part of a conditional check before the exit, a common evasion technique.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target the conditional checks before the `ExitProcess` call, which is a more likely point of evasion. The patterns are concrete sequences of instructions found in the trace, increasing the likelihood of a successful bypass. The use of `cape_options` allows for skipping instructions based on these patterns.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 85 F0 FE FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
