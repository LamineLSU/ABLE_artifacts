This indicates that the rule matched a location that wasn't the actual evasion check or decision point. We need to shift focus to earlier parts of the trace, targeting the conditional logic *before* the ExitProcess call. Strategy A (Evasion Check) is prioritized. I've chosen three distinct patterns from the trace, concentrating on the initial test and conditional jump sequence.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: The chosen patterns target the initial conditional test before the ExitProcess call, attempting to disrupt the evasion logic.
