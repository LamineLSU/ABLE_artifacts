To address this, I'm focusing on the conditional logic *before* the `ExitProcess` call, which is a common pattern in evasion techniques. I'm also introducing more concrete bytes to reduce false positives. Strategy B (Exit Decision) is prioritized.  I've chosen three different sequences leading up to the `ExitProcess` call, attempting to identify points where the execution flow might be influenced by evasion checks.
