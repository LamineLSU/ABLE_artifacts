This indicates the rule is matching the correct code but not at the precise point where the decision to exit is made or where an evasion check is performed. We'll shift focus to identifying conditional checks before the `ExitProcess` call (Strategy B). I'm selecting patterns that appear before the `ExitProcess` call and involve conditional jumps or comparisons. I'm prioritizing patterns that seem to be directly involved in the logic leading to the exit.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are located closer to the decision point for exiting the process. The patterns target specific instructions involved in the conditional check before the final exit.
