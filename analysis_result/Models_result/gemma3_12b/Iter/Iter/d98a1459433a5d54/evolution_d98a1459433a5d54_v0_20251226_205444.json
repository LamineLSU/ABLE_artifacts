We need to shift focus to earlier parts of the trace and specifically target conditional checks before the ExitProcess call.

We also include a pattern targeting a call instruction followed by a test and conditional jump.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target conditional checks that might be present before the ExitProcess call. Including conditional jumps helps ensure the skip offsets are applied only when the specific code path is taken, which is crucial for bypassing evasion checks.
