I'll focus on instructions that seem to be critical decision points leading to the `ExitProcess`.\n\n**Analysis & Pattern Selection**\n\nLooking at the traces, the common point is the `ExitProcess` call. The code leading up to it appears to be performing checks or calculations before the exit. Let's identify potential bypass points that could alter the program flow.\n\n**TRACE #1 & #2 - Key Pattern Identification**\n\nThe most significant sequence is the `call dword ptr [0022A12Ch]` (or similar) just before `ExitProcess`. This is likely a call to a function based on some calculated value.  Bypassing this call is a primary target.\n\n**TRACE #3 & #4 - Key Pattern Identification**\n\nThe `call 0040E7C3h` followed by `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` seems to be a key sequence. The second call is likely dependent on the result of the first.\n\n**TRACE #5 - Key Pattern Identification**\n\nThe sequence `call dword ptr [0135E18Ch]` seems critical, as it's right before the exit.\n\n**Generated YARA Patterns**\n\nHere are three YARA patterns, formatted as requested, targeting the identified bypass points.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 85 F0 FE FF FF 8B 8D F8 FE FF FF 03 C3 BA 04 01 00 00 03 C1 B9 42 8C 22 00 50 E8 E3 FA FF FF }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B FF 55 8BEC FF 75 08 FF 15 ACB0 41 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8BEC E8 07 26 00 00 83 F8 01 74 20 FF 75 08 FF 15 3CE1 35 01 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **`$pattern0`**: Targets the `call dword ptr [0022A12Ch]` sequence in traces 1 and 2. This pattern is long (24 bytes) to include surrounding context and avoid triggering new signatures.  The `??` are not needed here as the addresses are fixed.\n*   **`$pattern1`**: Targets the `call 0040E7C3h` and `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` sequence in traces 3 and 4. This pattern is 13 bytes long.\n*   **`$pattern2`**: Targets the `call dword ptr [0135E18Ch]` sequence in trace 5. This pattern is 21 bytes long.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Pattern 0:**  The call to `dword ptr [0022A12Ch]` is a strong candidate because it's likely dependent on some calculation, and bypassing it could prevent the exit.\n*   **Pattern 1:** The `call 0040E7C3h` is a potential point to alter the program flow.\n*   **Pattern 2:** The `call dword ptr [0135E18Ch]` is a very likely exit point and bypassing it might prevent the exit.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Testing:** These patterns are based on analysis. Thorough testing is absolutely essential to confirm that they actually bypass the evasion.\n*   **Specificity:**  These patterns are designed to be relatively specific to the observed behavior.  If the malware exhibits significant polymorphism, these patterns might not work.\n*   **Context:** The effectiveness of these patterns may depend on the surrounding code and the overall behavior of the malware.\n*   **CAPE Options:** The `cape_options` are set to skip the matched instructions.  Adjust these options as needed for your specific testing environment.\n*   **Wildcards:** I have not used wildcards in these patterns, as the addresses were fixed. If the addresses vary, wildcards should be added.\n",

Thorough testing is absolutely essential to confirm that they actually bypass the evasion.\n*   **Specificity:**  These patterns are designed to be relatively specific to the observed behavior.  If the malware exhibits significant polymorphism, these patterns might not work.\n*   **Context:** The effectiveness of these patterns may depend on the surrounding code and the overall behavior of the malware.\n*   **CAPE Options:** The `cape_options` are set to skip the matched instructions.  Adjust these options as needed for your specific testing environment.\n*   **Wildcards:** I have not used wildcards in these patterns, as the addresses were fixed. If the addresses vary, wildcards should be added.\n",
