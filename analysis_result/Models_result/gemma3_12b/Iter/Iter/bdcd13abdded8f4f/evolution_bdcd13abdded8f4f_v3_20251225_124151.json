The repeated sequences and use of `lea` and `push` suggests an attempt to obfuscate or manipulate memory. The multiple calls to `00418790h` might be a key part of the evasion logic, possibly involving some form of integrity check or environment detection.  The `FFD0` (call eax) at `00417F08` seems to be the exit point, and is the primary target for bypassing. The repeated instructions are likely to avoid detection or to check for changes to memory.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are three bypass points:\n\n1. **`FFD0` (call eax) at `00417F08`:** This is the clear exit point. Bypassing this directly would prevent the malware from exiting and would allow the analysis to continue.\n2. **`E844090000` (call 00418790h) at `00417EB7`:** This call is repeated many times. Skipping one of these might disrupt the evasion logic.\n3. **`FFD2` (call edx) at `00417ECD`:** This is part of a loop, and could be a place to disrupt the execution flow.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are the patterns, following the rules and including surrounding context:\n\n**Pattern 0 (Bypass `call eax`):**\n\nThis pattern focuses on skipping the exit call.\n`52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3` (11 bytes)\n\n**Pattern 1 (Bypass `call 00418790h`):**\n\nThis pattern aims to skip one of the repeated calls to `00418790h`.\n`E844090000 8B5514 8B4510 8B4D0C` (16 bytes)\n\n**Pattern 2 (Bypass `call edx`):**\n\nThis pattern aims to skip the `call edx` inside the loop.\n`8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3` (11 bytes)\n\n**YARA Rule:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3 }\n        $pattern1 = { E844090000 8B5514 8B4510 8B4D0C }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`$pattern0`**: This pattern directly replaces the `call eax` instruction that triggers the exit.\n*   **`$pattern1`**: This pattern replaces the `call 00418790h` and the following instructions.\n*   **`$pattern2`**: This pattern replaces the `call edx` instruction.\n\nThis YARA rule provides three bypasses to disrupt the malware's evasion logic and potentially allow further analysis.\n",
