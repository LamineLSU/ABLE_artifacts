      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and construct three bypass patterns according to the requirements.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying Suspicious Instructions**\n\nThe trace terminates with `FFD0` (call eax) at `00417F08`. This is likely the point where the malware detects the sandbox/VM and exits. Let's trace back to understand the logic leading to this call.  The `loope` instruction at `00417E97` is also a strong candidate for evasion logic. The repeated `push` instructions, especially near the end of the trace, also suggest possible hooks or checks.\n\n**Step 2: Tracing the Exit Path Backwards**\n\nThe `call eax` at `00417F08` is the exit point. The preceding `push edx` and `FFD0` are part of the call. Before that, `pop esi` and `pop ebp` are restoring registers. The jump to `00417E98` controlled by `loope` seems important.  The repeated instructions from `00417E9E` onwards also warrant investigation.\n\n**Step 3: Selecting Bypass Candidates**\n\nHere are three candidate instructions for bypassing the evasion:\n\n1.  **`FFD0` (call eax) at 00417F08:**  This is the direct exit. Bypassing this would prevent the malware from exiting.\n2.  **`088B88140A00` (or byte ptr [ebx+000A1488h], cl) at 00417F15:**  This looks like a check on a specific memory location. Skipping it might prevent the malware from detecting the environment.\n3.  **`6A36` (push 00000036h) at 00417EED:** This push could be part of a stack check or some other detection mechanism.\n\n**Step 4: Building Patterns**\n\nHere are the three patterns, combining the candidate instructions with surrounding context:\n\n1.  **Pattern 1 (Bypassing `call eax`):**  `52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3` (11 bytes). This pattern captures the instructions immediately preceding the `call eax`.\n2.  **Pattern 2 (Bypassing `or byte ptr [ebx+000A1488h], cl`):** `7EBE C3 55 8BEC 8B4508 8B88140A0000` (13 bytes). This includes the `jle` instruction that controls the loop and the `or` instruction.\n3.  **Pattern 3 (Bypassing `push 00000036h`):** `6A36 6A00 51 8DB07C0C0000 56` (11 bytes). This pattern includes the `push` instruction and the subsequent `lea` instruction.\n\n**Step 5: Applying Wildcards and Generating the YARA Rule**\n\nNow, let's apply wildcards to address/offset bytes and create the YARA rule.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B 16 50 51 FF ?? ?? ?? ?? 5E 5D C3 }\n        $pattern1 = { 7E BE ??
