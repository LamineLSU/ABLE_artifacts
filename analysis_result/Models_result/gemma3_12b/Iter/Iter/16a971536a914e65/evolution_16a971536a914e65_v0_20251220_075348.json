I've selected three distinct patterns from the trace that fit this profile, attempting to bypass a potential check before the exit.

This suggests the initial patterns were too rigid. We'll focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check) by targeting the conditional test before the ExitProcess call. We will also incorporate a conditional check before the exit call using Strategy B. The goal is to skip over the evasion check logic by identifying and bypassing the conditional jump.
