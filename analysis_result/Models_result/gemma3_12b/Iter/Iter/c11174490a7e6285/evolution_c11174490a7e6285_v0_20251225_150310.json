To address this, I'm shifting focus towards identifying and targeting evasion checks before the `ExitProcess` call. I'm selecting patterns that represent common checks used to detect virtualization or debugging environments, which are often used in evasion techniques. I'm also incorporating patterns that target conditional jumps related to the exit process itself. The goal is to disrupt the evasion logic rather than directly bypassing the exit.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are based on observed code sequences in the trace that appear to be part of an evasion check before the exit. They target specific instructions and registers used in the check. The inclusion of wildcards allows for slight variations in the code while still targeting the intended functionality.  The `cape_options` will attempt to skip over these sections.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
