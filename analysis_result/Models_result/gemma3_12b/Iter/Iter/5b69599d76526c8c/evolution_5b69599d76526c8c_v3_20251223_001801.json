      "raw_response": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and craft some bypass patterns.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nThe malware likely checks for a virtualized or sandboxed environment. The presence of `call eax` at `0041E86B` is suspicious. It's a call to an address held in the `eax` register, which suggests a dynamically determined function. The preceding instructions load a value into `eax`. This is a prime candidate for an evasion check.  The `push 00000035h` and `push 00000000h` suggest some kind of parameter being passed. The `lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000AA0h]` and `lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000AA8h]` are also suspicious. They're likely calculating addresses based on a value in `eax`, which further suggests a dynamic check.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThe goal is to prevent the `call eax` from executing.  We need to find a way to modify the value in `eax` *before* it's used in the call.  The most promising approach is to skip the instructions that calculate `eax`.  If we can skip the `call 0041F163h` and the subsequent instructions, we might be able to prevent the evasion check.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSkipping a function call is a fairly obvious bypass.  A sophisticated malware author would likely have checks to detect skipped instructions. However, it's a good starting point.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1.  **Skip the first `call 0041F163h`:**  This call is likely calculating the address that ends up in `eax`.\n2.  **Skip the `call eax`:** This is the actual evasion check.\n3.  **Skip the `call 0041F163h` in the second block:** Same reasoning as point 1, but in the second block of code.\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\nHere are three patterns, adhering to the length and wildcard rules.\n\n**Pattern 0: Skip the first `call 0041F163h`**\n\n`8DB0A00A0000 56 50 E824130000` (12 bytes)\nThis pattern covers the `lea` instruction and the `call` instruction. It is important to include the `lea` as it sets up the address for the `call`.\n\n**Pattern 1: Skip the `call eax`**\n\n`8B5514 8B4510 8B4D0C 83C414 52` (11 bytes)\nThis pattern skips the instructions that load the values into `edx`, `eax`, `ecx`, and `esp`, and then pushes `edx`. This bypasses the call to the dynamically computed address.\n\n**Pattern 2: Skip the second `call 0041F163h`**\n\n`8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000` (12 bytes)\nThis pattern covers the `lea` instruction and the `call` instruction in the second block of code.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8DB0A00A0000 56 50 E824130000 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B5514 8B4510 8B4D0C 83C414 52 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8DB0A80A0000 56 50 E824130000 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
