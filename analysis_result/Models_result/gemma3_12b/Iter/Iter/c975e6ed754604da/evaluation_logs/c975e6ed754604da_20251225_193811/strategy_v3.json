(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "Okay, let's analyze the trace and build some bypass patterns.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe malware is likely trying to detect a virtualized/sandboxed environment. The `ExitProcess` calls at the end of both traces are a strong indicator of this.  The malware probably checks for the presence of a debugger or other analysis tools. The `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` likely resolves a function pointer that performs the evasion check. The `call 0040E7C3h` might be related to the function pointer resolution or a preliminary check. The `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` suggests a parameter is being passed to the function.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nThe most promising bypass points are related to the `call` instructions. If we can prevent those calls from happening, we might be able to skip the evasion check and continue execution.\n\n*   **Target 1:** `0040E7F6  E8C8FFFFFF       call 0040E7C3h` - Skipping this call might prevent the initial check.\n*   **Target 2:** `0040E7FF  FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` - This is the most critical call.  Skipping it should bypass the core evasion logic.\n*   **Target 3:** `0040E7F3  FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` - By manipulating the value on the stack, we could potentially influence the evasion check. However, this is more complex and less reliable than skipping the `call` instructions.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nSkipping the `call` instructions is the most straightforward bypass. The attacker would likely notice if the call stack is altered, so this bypass might be detectable.  Manipulating the stack would be more subtle but harder to implement reliably.\n\n**Phase 4: Selected Bypass Points**\n\n1.  `0040E7F6  E8C8FFFFFF       call 0040E7C3h`\n2.  `0040E7FF  FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`\n3.  `0040E7F3  FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`\n\n**Phase 5: Build Patterns**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 59 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n*   **$pattern0:**  Combines `mov edi, edi`, `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`, `call 0040E7C3h`, `pop ecx`.  This skips the first `call`.\n*   **$pattern1:** Combines `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]` and `call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`. This skips the main evasion check.\n*   **$pattern2:** Combines `mov edi, edi`, `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`. This skips the initial stack setup.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   The `??` wildcards are not needed here because all addresses are already resolved by the malware's own code.\n*   The patterns are designed to be relatively short and specific to the provided trace.\n*   The effectiveness of these bypasses will depend on the specific implementation of the evasion check.  Further analysis may be required to refine these patterns.\n*   The attacker may implement countermeasures to detect and prevent these bypasses.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts failed because the rule hit but produced no new signatures, indicating the pattern matched a location that wasn't the actual evasion check or decision point.  The feedback suggests moving earlier in the trace and focusing on the decision-making process before the `ExitProcess` call.  I'm focusing on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and Strategy B (Exit Decision) by targeting conditional jumps before the `ExitProcess` calls. I'm extracting three distinct sequences from the trace that appear to be involved in conditional logic.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are extracted directly from the trace and represent conditional checks likely influencing the execution path. The patterns focus on `test` instructions followed by conditional jumps or comparison instructions, which are common in evasion checks. Using concrete bytes minimizes false positives. The `cape_options` will attempt to skip over these patterns, effectively altering the code flow.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B 45 FC 83 F8 01 75 0C }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8B EC 83 EC 10 74 05 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
