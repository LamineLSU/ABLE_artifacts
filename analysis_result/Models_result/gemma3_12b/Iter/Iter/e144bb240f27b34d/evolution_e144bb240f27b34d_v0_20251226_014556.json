This evolution focuses on simpler, more concrete patterns directly derived from the trace, prioritizing those that appear before the ExitProcess calls.

Strategy A (Evasion Check) is prioritized, targeting potential checks before the exit.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are chosen for their presence in the trace, their proximity to the exit calls, and their potential to represent checks before the exit.
