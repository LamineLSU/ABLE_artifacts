The analysis suggests focusing on the `call 00D2667Fh` sequence, which appears to be a key element of the evasion technique.  We'll also incorporate the preceding `push 0000005Bh` as part of the pattern.  To allow for some flexibility, we'll use wildcards for the surrounding bytes where appropriate. We will target the instruction sequence just before the `call 00D2667Fh` as a potential bypass point.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: This rule focuses on the instruction sequence directly leading to the evasion check. The inclusion of the `push 0000005Bh` provides a more specific trigger, while the wildcards allow for variations in surrounding code.  Targeting this sequence is more likely to bypass the evasion check without triggering false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
