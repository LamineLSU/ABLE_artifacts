We'll focus on Strategy A (Evasion Check) and look for a conditional jump after a test instruction. We'll also include a second pattern focusing on the call to a function that appears to be related to the exit process, and a third pattern focusing on a specific comparison instruction.  The goal is to identify the decision-making point related to the exit, not the exit itself.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are extracted directly from the trace and target key instructions likely involved in the exit decision process. The `CALL_TEST_JE` pattern targets a potential check before exiting. The `API_CHECK` pattern targets a call to a specific function, likely involved in the exit process. The `CMP_SETZ` pattern targets a specific comparison that might be related to the decision.
