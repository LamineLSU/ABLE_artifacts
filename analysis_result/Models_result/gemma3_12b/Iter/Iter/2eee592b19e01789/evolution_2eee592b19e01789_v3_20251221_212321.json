      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**:\n\nThe previous attempts failed because of overly specific patterns and incorrect use of skip offsets. Following the analysis, I'm broadening the patterns, removing skip offsets, and changing the condition from `any of them` to `all of them` to enforce a specific sequence. I am focusing on Strategy A (Evasion Check), targeting a CALL instruction followed by a TEST EAX and a conditional jump. I'm also adding a second pattern focusing on a conditional check before a call, and a third focusing on a call to a function. The patterns are derived directly from the trace provided, ensuring accuracy and minimizing the risk of false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**:\n\nThese patterns target a common evasion technique: checking the EAX register after a call to determine if the program is running in a virtual machine or debugger. The `all of them` condition ensures that these instructions are executed in the correct order.  The use of concrete bytes increases specificity, while wildcards for offsets allow for minor variations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 4883EC20 8BD9 E827000000 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF15A9160100 488BC8 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF151E170100 }\n\n    condition:\n        all of them\n}\n```",
