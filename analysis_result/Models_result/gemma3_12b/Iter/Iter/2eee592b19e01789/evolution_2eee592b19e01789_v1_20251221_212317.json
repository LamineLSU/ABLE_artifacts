The analysis suggests focusing on the `call qword ptr [00007FF778B2A258h]` instruction, which appears to be a key evasion check. I am using three patterns extracted from the trace, targeting different aspects of this check and surrounding code. I'm removing `cape_options` as they were complicating the rule.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: VM_DETECT\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target the instruction sequence leading up to the suspicious call. Pattern 0 targets the `test al, al` instruction and following jump. Pattern 1 targets the call to the function at `00007FF778B2A128h` which is called before the main call. Pattern 2 targets the call to `00007FF778B2A258h` directly. The use of wildcards in the offset addresses allows for some flexibility in the addresses being called.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { FF151E170100 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF153F180100 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
