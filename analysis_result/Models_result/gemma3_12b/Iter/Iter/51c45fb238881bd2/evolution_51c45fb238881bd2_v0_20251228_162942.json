The cape_options will be used to skip over these potential checks, allowing the execution to continue.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 65\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target the conditional jump after the test instruction, which is a critical decision point in the evasion logic.
