Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. Let me start by understanding what was done before.\n\nIn the latest attempt, a YARA rule was tried but it didn't hit any new signatures, meaning it either matched the wrong location or wasn't specific enough. The initial rule likely used patterns from the trace but failed to bypass because it was either too broad or targeted the wrong part of the code.\n\nLooking at the original trace, there are two traces: one starting with 012161F8 and another with 003D61F8. Each has a series of instructions leading up to an exit process call. Strategy A is about bypassing an early check in the trace, Strategy B is about bypassing before the exit call, and Strategy C uses unique techniques like timing or detection.\n\nSince the previous rule didn't hit any new signatures, it's probably because the patterns matched too broadly or were placed at the wrong location. So I need to be more specific about where the bypass occurs.\n\nI should focus on using 6-20 bytes from the trace for each pattern and ensure they're concrete where possible. Also, if multiple strategies didn't work, maybe there are other ways to bypass that weren't considered before.\n\nLooking at Trace #1, after the initial test+je sequence, it proceeds through various function calls like mov eax, dword ptr, etc., leading up to an exit process call. Similarly, Trace #2 has a similar structure but starts with a different instruction.\n\nI think using specific patterns from these traces could help bypass earlier and avoid the broad matches that failed before. For example, looking for a test+je sequence followed by mov could be a good target since it's early in the trace and less likely to have been used before.\n\nAlso, considering that some exits might use conditional calls (Strategy B), maybe checking if there's an unconditional call first could bypass them more reliably. This would involve matching the pattern right before the exit call, ensuring the condition isn't triggered.\n\nAnother thought is using patterns from specific function sequences where the code branches or uses certain jumps. Maybe looking for a specific RDTSC instruction with timing that matches typical bypass behaviors.\n\nI should create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns based on different points in the trace, each targeting a unique section to increase specificity and avoid previous overlaps.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts failed because the YARA rule matched broad patterns or incorrect locations. By focusing on specific instructions from the trace where bypassing is likely effective (early checks, before exits), we can create more targeted patterns.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK, RDTSC TIMING\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: Using exact hex sequences from key points in the traces increases specificity. Targeting early test+je and conditional calls before exits makes the bypass more reliable without broad matching.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting specific trace patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 7412 6A5B 5A 8BCE E8250500 }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D00 1000 0000 0F82 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B4DFC 5F 5E 33CD 5B }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
