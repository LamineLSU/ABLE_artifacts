(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this malware trace that's exiting early due to some sandbox evasion techniques. The goal is to find a way for the attacker to bypass these evasions by finding where the checks are and then figuring out how they could be manipulated.\n\nLooking at the trace data, it starts with an exit process instruction, so maybe the first thing I should check is what's happening right before that exit. There's a call to 'edx' at 0x0041a64d. Hmm, if this is called from within the sandbox, perhaps there's some protection against jumping out.\n\nWait, earlier in the trace, there are multiple calls and pushes on the stack. Maybe the attacker is using a stack-based bypass where they call an instruction that's not supposed to be called normally. For example, in phase 1, I thought about how the attacker might have implemented checks like checking if 'call' is being used or if certain addresses are accessed.\n\nLooking at the instructions, right before the exit, there's FFD2 call edx. Maybe the check is whether 'call' is followed by a valid instruction. If they can make this instruction skip, then execution would continue instead of exiting.\n\nSo perhaps the bypass involves making that 'call' instruction skip or not execute properly. That way, when it gets to the exit process, it's not called as expected and continues executing, causing the analysis to terminate without exiting early.\n\nAnother thought: There are multiple push operations on different registers like 'edx', 'eax', etc., but maybe the attacker is trying to manipulate some flags or registers in a way that bypasses certain checks. For example, if there's a check for whether a register has been modified, the attacker could alter it without detection.\n\nAlso, looking at instruction 0x0041a689: mov edx, dword ptr [esi]. If 'call' is at 0x0041a64d, maybe that's part of an address check. Maybe the attacker can find a way to not trigger this or bypass it.\n\nI'm also noticing a lot of push and pop operations on the stack (like pushing and popping 'ebp', 'edx', etc.). Perhaps the attacker is using the stack to simulate some legitimate behavior without being detected, like calling a function that doesn't do anything but stays within the bounds checked by the sandbox.\n\nWait, earlier in the trace, there's an instruction at 0x0041a6c8: FFD0 call eax. Maybe this is another point where the attacker can cause bypass if they manipulate the instruction flow here.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the main points of interest are the 'call' instructions and any stack operations that could be used to hide legitimate calls or bypass checks. The goal is to find three different places where these calls can be made to skip or bypass the detection.\n\nSo, maybe the first pattern involves the call at 0x0041a64d being skipped. Then another pattern involving a different 'call' instruction like FFD0, and a third one elsewhere in the trace that could also be manipulated.\n</think>\n\nTo address the malware's sandbox evasion techniques, we've identified three distinct patterns where bypassing checks can occur based on the provided trace analysis.\n\n**Bypass Points Identified:**\n\n1. **Call at 0x0041a64d**\n   - This call might be part of an address check. By making this instruction skip or not execute properly, execution continues past the bypass point.\n   \n2. **Call at 0x0041a6c8**\n   - Another potential call target where bypassing can occur if executed improperly, leading to continued program flow without triggering exit.\n\n3. **Stack-Based Manipulation**\n   - Using stack operations (push/pop) on various registers could hide legitimate calls or bypass checks by simulating unexpected behavior within the sandbox.\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionBypass {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypasses sandbox/VM evasion through call and stack manipulation\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0041A648 52 8B16 FFD2 5E 5D C3 }  # Skipping 'call' instruction\n        $pattern1 = { 0041A6C8 FFD0 8B06 E844 }       # Bypassing a call to 'eax'\n        $pattern2 = { 6A35 6A00 51 8DB07C0C 8B550C }   # Manipulating stack operations\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. The original task was to bypass a piece of malware using YARA rules with three specific strategies: Evasion Check, Exit Decision, or Evasion Techniques.\n\nLooking at the latest attempt, it failed because there were no new signatures, which probably means the pattern matched but in the wrong location. From the evolution history, strategy A (Evasion Check) didn't work this time, so maybe moving earlier in the trace would help. Also, since the previous attempts had 60% success with strategy A, perhaps I can refine that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll review the trace data provided to identify possible patterns from the first 30% of the trace where an instruction like a test or je could be used as a bypass point. The goal is to find specific sequences that bypass the exit process call.\n\nLooking at the trace, I notice several calls and conditions:\n- At line 0041A68D: FFD2 call edx\nThis seems like a potential candidate for a bypass because it's part of the exit process.\n- Line 0041A67C: mov edx, dword ptr [ebp+14h]\nAnother possible instruction that could be manipulated.\n\nI'll need to create three different patterns based on these observations. Each pattern should be specific enough but also generic where necessary, using wildcards for varying offsets or addresses.\n\nFor the first pattern, maybe I can target the call to EDX and include some conditions before it. For example, a test or je instruction right before the call might bypass the check. Similarly, another pattern could involve a comparison like cmp eax,imm followed by a jump if not equal (jb). The third pattern might be using a specific address offset in the stack.\n\nI'll structure each pattern to cover 6-20 bytes, ensuring that all hex values are exact from the trace and any unknown offsets use wildcards. Then, I'll set up the YARA rule with these patterns and include them in the cape_options.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original bypass attempt didn't find new signatures, indicating it matched at the wrong location or missed potential points. Moving earlier to strategy A (Evasion Check) increases chances of hitting an exit decision before the actual action.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | CMP_SETZ | RDTSC\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70-80% (Refined from previous attempts)\n\n**REASONING**: Three specific patterns targeting early exit points with test or comparison instructions, ensuring they bypass the decision logic before execution.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - refined\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC ?? ?? ?? ??
