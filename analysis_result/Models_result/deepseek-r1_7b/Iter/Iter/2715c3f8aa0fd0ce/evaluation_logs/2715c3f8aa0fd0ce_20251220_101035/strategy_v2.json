        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this Yara rule because it's not working correctly due to some validation errors. The main issues are that the patterns are too short and each needs to be between 6-20 bytes. Also, they must come from the provided trace data, which is two traces with specific instruction sequences.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the previous attempt, the patterns were only 3 and 5 bytes long, which is why they failed. Each pattern needs to be more detailed by including surrounding instructions so they're longer but still specific enough.\n\nLooking at the trace data, each has a similar sequence: it starts with pushing ebp, then moving esp to ebp, calling DF02h, comparing AL value, jumping if necessary, and so on. The exit happens after several jumps and function calls.\n\nI need to create three different patterns that capture the evasion points. Each pattern should include enough context around the target instruction so that it's unique but still specific.\n\nLet me think about each pattern:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Maybe this is where the conditional jump based on AL value happens. So, after the call to DF02h, there's a test on AL and then a jump if not equal to 0x01. I can capture that part along with surrounding instructions.\n\n2. Pattern 1: This could be the part after the call where it checks AL again but jumps differently or continues execution. Maybe this is when the program continues past another conditional.\n\n3. Pattern 2: Perhaps before any of these, there's a push instruction on ebp which might be bypassed. Including that context would make the pattern longer and more specific.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern uses wildcards for address/offset bytes and keeps opcode and register encodings concrete.\n\nFor example, for Pattern 0, I can include the call instruction (E8), then some wildcards for offset bytes since it's not specified. Then after the test on AL, the jump if necessary would be part of the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, Pattern 1 might capture a different conditional jump or continuation after a certain operation. Maybe another test and jump elsewhere.\n\nPattern 2 could include an earlier instruction like pushing ebp again (8B) followed by some wildcards for displacement, making it specific to that point in the trace.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long. Since combining two or three consecutive instructions into one pattern should help reach this length.\n\nLet me draft each pattern:\n\nPattern 0: Maybe includes the push ebp, then the mov esp, call DF02h, test al, and jump if not equal to 1. So something like 8BEC (mov esp), E8F7... etc., with wildcards for any unknown offsets.\n\nPattern 1: Could be after another instruction where a different conditional is handled, perhaps using a different op code or offset.\n\nPattern 2: Maybe includes the initial push ebp and some displacement to capture that point.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern doesn't repeat bytes and captures unique parts of the trace. Also, all address/offsets are replaced with ?? wildcards.\n\nNow, I'll structure each $patternX accordingly, making sure they're different from each other and meet the length requirement.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the Yara rule, we need to create three distinct patterns based on the provided trace data. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions while applying wildcards to address/offsets.\n\nHere is the corrected Yara rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            8B EC         # Push ebp\n            E8 F7 25 00   # Call DF02h with offset ?? and 0x00\n            83 F8 01      # Compare AL to 0x01\n            74 20         # Jump if not equal to 0x01 (je)\n            FF 75 08       # Push some data to stack\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            E8 F7 ?? ??   # Call DF02h with unknown offset (??)\n            0F 84         # Displacement of ?? bytes from previous push\n            ??:?           # Wildcard for any offset after test\n            FF 75 08       # Push some data to stack\n            8B C9          # Push -1 to the stack (wildcard)\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            6A ??          # Instruction with address at +?? and ??\n            5A ??          # Instruction with address at +??\n            8B CE           # Move value from PC+?? to R0\n            E8 F7 05 00    # Call DF02h with offset 0x05 (wildcard)\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any_ofthem\n}\n```",

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

Let me go through everything step by step.\n\nFirst, the original rule had two $pattern entries instead of three, which is a problem because it needs exactly three: $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2. So I'll add another pattern while ensuring all are different.\n\nNext, each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long. The previous patterns were too short, so I need to expand them by including more instructions from the trace data. Each pattern should include the target instruction plus surrounding context to make them specific enough without being unique.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I'll choose three different suspicious points where skipping would likely bypass evasion. For each of these, I'll create a 6-12 byte pattern that includes the relevant instructions and some wildcards for any address or offset bytes.\n\nI also need to apply wildcard rules correctly: replacing all addresses and offsets with '??'. Additionally, I must ensure that opcode and register-encoding bytes are kept concrete. \n\nLet me draft each pattern:\n\nFor $pattern0, I'll take the call instruction (E8 25 05 00) and surrounding context like push instructions to make a longer sequence.\n\n$pattern1 can include another call with different offsets, maybe E8 ?? ?? ??\n\n$pattern2 will cover yet another set of instructions from the trace, ensuring it's unique.\n\nFinally, I'll format them correctly in YARA syntax, making sure each is wrapped in braces and has the right number of bytes. Also, I'll add the necessary cape_options to the meta section.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection rule (patterns include wildcards)\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 25 ?? ?? ?? 8B 47 03 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 ?? ??
