      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to correct this Yara rule based on the user's problem. The original rule was marked as incorrect because it didn't meet all the requirements specified in the task. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a Yara rule that they believe is incorrect and some trace data from a malware execution. Their main goal is to fix this rule so that it correctly bypasses certain checks.\n\nLooking at the original rule, it has three patterns, but it seems like the instructions are missing wildcards where necessary. The user mentioned that each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards for address or offset bytes. Also, they emphasized that all three patterns should be different.\n\nIn the initial rule, I noticed that some parts have '??' which is correct for wildcards, but maybe not enough or in the wrong places. For example, in the first pattern, there are multiple '??', but perhaps it's too short. The user also wants to ensure that each pattern includes context bytes after calls or jumps to avoid new signatures.\n\nI recall from the validation errors that the rule was missing some elements like proper wildcards and addressing rules. So, I need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes by combining multiple instructions if necessary. Also, any address or offset should be replaced with '??', but opcode and register bytes should stay concrete.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I see several function calls like E8 and 8B. These could correspond to different bypass points. So, each pattern might target a specific call instruction.\n\nI also need to include the correct `cape_options` in the meta section so that the Yara rule works as expected. The user mentioned that this was missing, so adding \"count=0\" is necessary along with other parameters like opcode and action.\n\nAnother thing to check is ensuring each pattern is unique and doesn't repeat any sequences from the original incorrect rule. This will help in making sure the bypass is effective against different variants of the malware.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll construct three distinct patterns, each meeting the 6-20 byte requirement, including wildcards where appropriate, and ensure they cover different call points based on the trace data provided.\n</think>\n\n```\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting function calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help correct this Yara rule based on the provided information. The user has given a bunch of trace data and some existing code that's generating an error. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: the patterns are too short. Each pattern needs to be between 6 and 20 bytes. The original rule only had four bytes per pattern, which is definitely too short. So my first thought is that each pattern in the strings section needs to include more instructions to reach the required length.\n\nLooking at the original code, I see that the patterns are something like `85C0`, which is just two hex bytes, so 4 bytes when considering each byte as a separate value. That's way too short. So I need to expand each pattern by adding surrounding instructions and including context bytes after certain opcodes.\n\nNext, the user mentioned that all address/offset bytes must be replaced with `??`. In Yara, wildcards are used for this purpose. So any opcode or register encoding should stay concrete, but any address or offset in CALL/JMP or conditional jumps should be replaced with `??`.\n\nAlso, each pattern needs to be different and based on the provided trace data. The trace has several traces (from #1 to #5), so I can pick patterns from these.\n\nLet me start by looking at Trace #2 since it's similar to Trace #1 but slightly different in some instructions. Maybe I can find a way to combine multiple instructions into one pattern.\n\nLooking at the first few lines of Trace #2, I see `85C0`, which is probably a test on EAX. Then there are some push and pop operations. Maybe combining these with a following call could make a longer pattern.\n\nSo maybe the first pattern can be something like `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??`. Wait, but I need to include more bytes for context after the CALL opcode since it requires four bytes after the opcode. So perhaps after the call, we add some wildcards.\n\nWait, in Yara's pattern syntax, each byte is separated by spaces, so maybe `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F84 ...` but I need to make sure the displacement is correctly placed.\n\nHmm, actually, let me think about how to structure this. For a CALL instruction, it's followed by four bytes of offset. So if we have a pattern like `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`, that would cover the offset after the call.\n\nBut wait, in Trace #2, there are some instructions before the call, so maybe I can combine those into the pattern to make it longer. For example, include the test, push, pop, mov, and then the call with wildcards.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 1: `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??` – this includes a TEST instruction, some pushes and pops, a mov, and a call. That should be around 12 bytes including the wildcards.\n\nBut I need to make sure that each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace to avoid overlap.\n\nLooking at Trace #3 and #4, they involve E8C8FFFF as a call. Maybe using that in another pattern could help. So perhaps:\n\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? ??` – but wait, I need to include specific instructions from the trace. Let's see, in Trace #3 and #4, after E8C8FFFF, there's a push on the ebp+08h.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it as `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A ??` – but this might not capture all necessary bytes.\n\nAlternatively, for trace #4, which ends with `FF15ACB04100`, perhaps a pattern could be something like `FF15ACB0 4100` combined with some context before it. But I'm not sure if that's part of the same instruction sequence as others.\n\nWait, no, because each trace is separate, so maybe focusing on patterns within one trace first would make more sense to avoid mixing different traces which could confuse the detection.\n\nSo going back to Trace #2, after `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??`, that's a possible pattern. Let me count: 85 (1) + C0 (2) + 0F (3), 84 (4), then four wildcards for the offset (positions 5-8). Then 8B (9), 45 (10), and two wildcards after (positions 11-12). So that's 12 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, moving to another trace. Trace #3 has a call at E8C8FFFF, followed by pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Maybe combining that into a pattern: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? ?? 5A ??`.\n\nBut let me check the exact bytes:\n\nIn Trace #3:\n- E8C8FFFF is the call instruction.\n- Following it is `FF7508`, pushing to dword ptr [ebp+08h].\nThen, perhaps after that, another instruction.\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A ?? ...` but I need to include enough bytes to make it 6-20. Let's say:\n\nPattern 3: `E8C8FFFF 59 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0`. Hmm, that might be too short.\n\nWait, perhaps combining the call with some following instructions. Maybe include a few more bytes after the call to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, from Trace #4, there's a similar structure: `E8C8FFFF`, followed by pushing and so on.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`.\n\nWait, that might be 16 bytes. Let me count the spaces as separators:\n\nE8 (1) ??:4 (positions 2-5), then C8 (6), 5A (7-8), 8B (9), CE (10-11), E8 (12). Then ?? for three more after, but I need to see how many.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's: 4 (E8) + 4 (??) = 8 bytes so far. Then C8 is next, making it 9, then 5A makes 10-11, 8B is 12, CE 13-14, E8 15. Then ?? for three more: positions 16-18.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nE8 (1), four ??: 2-5,\nC8 (6),\n5A (7-8),\n8B (9),\nCE (10-11),\nE8 (12),\n?? (13),\n?? (14),\n?? (15).\n\nThat's 15 bytes, which is within the limit.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's capturing the correct context. Alternatively, maybe use a different part of the trace where instructions are more distinct.\n\nWait, in Trace #3 and #4, after E8C8FFFF, there's a call to dword ptr [00158588h], which is followed by a push on 00151140h. Maybe using that as part of the pattern:\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ??` – but I need to include more bytes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining a conditional jump with some instructions.\n\nLooking back at Trace #1 and #2, there's a JZ instruction. Maybe a pattern like `74 0C ?? ...`.\n\nWait, in Trace #1:\n- After the test, it's 6A (push), then 5A (pop), then 8BCE (mov to stack). Then E8C8FFFF call.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 3: `74 0C ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ??` – but not sure if that fits.\n\nAlternatively, considering the attacker's perspective, perhaps combining a conditional jump with some context after it. Like:\n\nPattern 1: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (from Trace #2)\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 0C ??` – but maybe too short.\nPattern 3: `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (from Trace #1)\n\nWait, let me check the lengths:\n\nPattern 1: 85C0 (2) + 0F84 (2 more → total 4), then four ??: positions 5-8. Then 8B45 (positions 9-10). Then two ?: positions 11-12. So that's 12 bytes.\n\nPattern 3: 6A ?? (positions 1-2) + 5A (position3), 8BCE (positions4-7), E8 ?? (positions8-9), then four ??: positions10-13, and 85C0 (positions14-15). So that's 16 bytes.\n\nPattern 2: Maybe using the call from Trace #2 or #4. Let me think about another part of the trace where instructions are unique.\n\nLooking at Trace #5:\n- The call is FF15ACB04101, followed by moving to dword ptr [0015A13Ch].\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `FF15ACB0 4101 ...` but I need more bytes. Alternatively, include the surrounding context.\n\nWait, in Trace #5, after FF15ACB0, there's 8BE5 as a call to dword ptr [0015A12Ch], then 59 pops eax, and so on.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 3: `FF ?? AC ?? B0 ...` – but I'm not sure. Maybe combining the call with some following instructions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the instruction before the call in Trace #5. For example, after the call comes a mov ebp, esp (8B4D), then E8E2 jumping to 00156207h.\n\nSo perhaps a pattern: `FF ?? AC B0 8B 4D E8 E2 ...` – but I need enough bytes.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nPattern 3: `FF15ACB0 8BE5 59 ?? 8F75 08 ?? 74 15 ?? ??`. That's too long. Maybe it's better to focus on the call and surrounding context in Trace #2 or another.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each pattern must be unique, perhaps using different traces for each pattern is better to avoid overlap. So:\n\nPattern 1: From Trace #2 (call with offset)\nPattern 2: From Trace #3 (E8C8FFFF call)\nPattern 3: From Trace #4 or #5\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible without overlapping. Maybe it's better to have all patterns from a single trace but different parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the first pattern is from Trace #2, second from Trace #3, and third from Trace #4.\n\nSo Pattern 1: From Trace #2 (call with offset)\nPattern 2: From Trace #3 (E8C8FFFF call followed by push)\nPattern 3: From Trace #4 (FF15ACB0... call)\n\nEach would have different instruction sequences, making them unique and specific enough.\n\nSo Pattern 1:\n`85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`\n\nPattern 2:\n`E8C8FFFF 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??`\n\nWait, but I need to include the displacement after the call. Let me think:\n\nIn Trace #3: After the call (E8C8FFFF), there's a push on dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF7508). Then more instructions.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 2: `E8C8FFFF ?? FF7508 ...` – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, include some following bytes after the call to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nPattern 2: `E8C8FFFF 59 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0`\n\nBut let me count the bytes here:\n- E8 (1), four ??: positions2-5\n- C8 (6)\n- FF (7,8)\n- 75 (9,10)\n- 08 (11)\nWait, that's already too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different part of the instruction sequence. Maybe include the call and some following pushes or pops.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should focus on creating patterns based on specific instruction sequences from each trace without overlapping too much with others.\n\nAnother approach: for each pattern, select 2-3 instructions that are unique in their context. Then expand to include surrounding instructions to reach the length requirement.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1 (from Trace #2):\n85 C0 is a test on EAX.\nThen 0F84 is adding 0x4 to ESI (a common pattern).\nThen TEST EAX, 00000110h – that's the JZ instruction. So maybe:\n\n85C0 0F84 740A ?? ?? ??. Wait, no, in Trace #2, it's 64A0 after the test.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nIn Trace #2, after TEST EAX, 64A0 is pushed to the stack. So maybe Pattern1: `85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 ?? ...` but that's too short. Alternatively, include more instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps combining TEST with some pushes and a call:\n\nPattern1: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (from earlier)\n\nThat should be 12 bytes.\n\nPattern2: From Trace #3, the call is E8C8FFFF. After that, it's pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], which is FF7508. So maybe:\n\nE8C8FFFF FF7508 ?? ... but I need more context after that to make it 6-20 bytes.\n\nAlternatively, including the following instructions: after push comes 03C9 (pop ebp), then 5A is pushed again? Wait, no, in Trace #3:\n\nAfter E8C8FFFF call:\nFF7508 is pushed as dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nThen 03C9 pops ebp\nThen 5A is pushed (0F40)\nThen 8BCE movs to stack.\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `E8C8FFFF FF7508 03C9 ?? 5A ...` – but I'm not sure. Maybe better to focus on the call and four bytes after it, then some context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nPattern2: `E8C8FFFF 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\nWait, that's combining the push (5A) before the call with the call itself and following instructions. But I need to include enough bytes for wildcards.\n\nI think it's better to create patterns based on specific instruction sequences without overlapping too much. So:\n\nPattern1: From Trace #2:\n85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 (push) ?? ??\n\nBut that might not be long enough. Alternatively, include more instructions after the push.\n\nAlternatively, combine TEST with some pushes and a call to create a longer pattern.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this, so let me try to draft the corrected YARA rule.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass based on stack displacement and specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 53 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFF FF7508 03C9 5A ?? 8BCE 85C0 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help correct this Yara rule based on the provided information. The user has given a bunch of trace data and some existing code that's generating an error. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: the patterns are too short. Each pattern needs to be between 6 and 20 bytes. The original rule only had four bytes per pattern, which is definitely too short. So my first thought is that each pattern in the strings section needs to include more instructions to reach the required length.\n\nLooking at the original code, I see that the patterns are something like `85C0`, which is just two hex bytes, so 4 bytes when considering each byte as a separate value. That's way too short. So I need to expand each pattern by adding surrounding instructions and including context bytes after certain opcodes.\n\nNext, the user mentioned that all address/offset bytes must be replaced with `??`. In Yara, wildcards are used for this purpose. So any opcode or register encoding should stay concrete, but any address or offset in CALL/JMP or conditional jumps should be replaced with `??`.\n\nAlso, each pattern needs to be different and based on the provided trace data. The trace has several traces (from #1 to #5), so I can pick patterns from these.\n\nLet me start by looking at Trace #2 since it's similar to Trace #1 but slightly different in some instructions. Maybe I can find a way to combine multiple instructions into one pattern.\n\nLooking at the first few lines of Trace #2, I see `85C0`, which is probably a test on EAX. Then there are some push and pop operations. Maybe combining these with a following call could make a longer pattern.\n\nSo maybe the first pattern can be something like `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??`. Wait, but I need to include more bytes for context after the CALL opcode since it requires four bytes after the opcode. So perhaps after the call, we add some wildcards.\n\nWait, in Yara's pattern syntax, each byte is separated by spaces, so maybe `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F84 ...` but I need to make sure the displacement is correctly placed.\n\nHmm, actually, let me think about how to structure this. For a CALL instruction, it's followed by four bytes of offset. So if we have a pattern like `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`, that would cover the offset after the call.\n\nBut wait, in Trace #2, there are some instructions before the call, so maybe I can combine those into the pattern to make it longer. For example, include the test, push, pop, mov, and then the call with wildcards.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 1: `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??` – this includes a TEST instruction, some pushes and pops, a mov, and a call. That should be around 12 bytes including the wildcards.\n\nBut I need to make sure that each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace to avoid overlap.\n\nLooking at Trace #3 and #4, they involve E8C8FFFF as a call. Maybe using that in another pattern could help. So perhaps:\n\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? ??` – but wait, I need to include specific instructions from the trace. Let's see, in Trace #3 and #4, after E8C8FFFF, there's a push on the ebp+08h.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it as `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A ??` – but this might not capture all necessary bytes.\n\nAlternatively, for trace #4, which ends with `FF15ACB04100`, perhaps a pattern could be something like `FF15ACB0 4100` combined with some context before it. But I'm not sure if that's part of the same instruction sequence as others.\n\nWait, no, because each trace is separate, so maybe focusing on patterns within one trace first would make more sense to avoid mixing different traces which could confuse the detection.\n\nSo going back to Trace #2, after `85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??`, that's a possible pattern. Let me count: 85 (1) + C0 (2) + 0F (3), 84 (4), then four wildcards for the offset (positions 5-8). Then 8B (9), 45 (10), and two wildcards after (positions 11-12). So that's 12 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, moving to another trace. Trace #3 has a call at E8C8FFFF, followed by pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Maybe combining that into a pattern: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? ?? 5A ??`.\n\nBut let me check the exact bytes:\n\nIn Trace #3:\n- E8C8FFFF is the call instruction.\n- Following it is `FF7508`, pushing to dword ptr [ebp+08h].\nThen, perhaps after that, another instruction.\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A ?? ...` but I need to include enough bytes to make it 6-20. Let's say:\n\nPattern 3: `E8C8FFFF 59 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0`. Hmm, that might be too short.\n\nWait, perhaps combining the call with some following instructions. Maybe include a few more bytes after the call to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, from Trace #4, there's a similar structure: `E8C8FFFF`, followed by pushing and so on.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`.\n\nWait, that might be 16 bytes. Let me count the spaces as separators:\n\nE8 (1) ??:4 (positions 2-5), then C8 (6), 5A (7-8), 8B (9), CE (10-11), E8 (12). Then ?? for three more after, but I need to see how many.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's: 4 (E8) + 4 (??) = 8 bytes so far. Then C8 is next, making it 9, then 5A makes 10-11, 8B is 12, CE 13-14, E8 15. Then ?? for three more: positions 16-18.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nE8 (1), four ??: 2-5,\nC8 (6),\n5A (7-8),\n8B (9),\nCE (10-11),\nE8 (12),\n?? (13),\n?? (14),\n?? (15).\n\nThat's 15 bytes, which is within the limit.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's capturing the correct context. Alternatively, maybe use a different part of the trace where instructions are more distinct.\n\nWait, in Trace #3 and #4, after E8C8FFFF, there's a call to dword ptr [00158588h], which is followed by a push on 00151140h. Maybe using that as part of the pattern:\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ??` – but I need to include more bytes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining a conditional jump with some instructions.\n\nLooking back at Trace #1 and #2, there's a JZ instruction. Maybe a pattern like `74 0C ?? ...`.\n\nWait, in Trace #1:\n- After the test, it's 6A (push), then 5A (pop), then 8BCE (mov to stack). Then E8C8FFFF call.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 3: `74 0C ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ??` – but not sure if that fits.\n\nAlternatively, considering the attacker's perspective, perhaps combining a conditional jump with some context after it. Like:\n\nPattern 1: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (from Trace #2)\nPattern 2: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 0C ??` – but maybe too short.\nPattern 3: `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (from Trace #1)\n\nWait, let me check the lengths:\n\nPattern 1: 85C0 (2) + 0F84 (2 more → total 4), then four ??: positions 5-8. Then 8B45 (positions 9-10). Then two ?: positions 11-12. So that's 12 bytes.\n\nPattern 3: 6A ?? (positions 1-2) + 5A (position3), 8BCE (positions4-7), E8 ?? (positions8-9), then four ??: positions10-13, and 85C0 (positions14-15). So that's 16 bytes.\n\nPattern 2: Maybe using the call from Trace #2 or #4. Let me think about another part of the trace where instructions are unique.\n\nLooking at Trace #5:\n- The call is FF15ACB04101, followed by moving to dword ptr [0015A13Ch].\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `FF15ACB0 4101 ...` but I need more bytes. Alternatively, include the surrounding context.\n\nWait, in Trace #5, after FF15ACB0, there's 8BE5 as a call to dword ptr [0015A12Ch], then 59 pops eax, and so on.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 3: `FF ?? AC ?? B0 ...` – but I'm not sure. Maybe combining the call with some following instructions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the instruction before the call in Trace #5. For example, after the call comes a mov ebp, esp (8B4D), then E8E2 jumping to 00156207h.\n\nSo perhaps a pattern: `FF ?? AC B0 8B 4D E8 E2 ...` – but I need enough bytes.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nPattern 3: `FF15ACB0 8BE5 59 ?? 8F75 08 ?? 74 15 ?? ??`. That's too long. Maybe it's better to focus on the call and surrounding context in Trace #2 or another.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each pattern must be unique, perhaps using different traces for each pattern is better to avoid overlap. So:\n\nPattern 1: From Trace #2 (call with offset)\nPattern 2: From Trace #3 (E8C8FFFF call)\nPattern 3: From Trace #4 or #5\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible without overlapping. Maybe it's better to have all patterns from a single trace but different parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the first pattern is from Trace #2, second from Trace #3, and third from Trace #4.\n\nSo Pattern 1: From Trace #2 (call with offset)\nPattern 2: From Trace #3 (E8C8FFFF call followed by push)\nPattern 3: From Trace #4 (FF15ACB0... call)\n\nEach would have different instruction sequences, making them unique and specific enough.\n\nSo Pattern 1:\n`85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`\n\nPattern 2:\n`E8C8FFFF 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??`\n\nWait, but I need to include the displacement after the call. Let me think:\n\nIn Trace #3: After the call (E8C8FFFF), there's a push on dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF7508). Then more instructions.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 2: `E8C8FFFF ?? FF7508 ...` – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, include some following bytes after the call to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nPattern 2: `E8C8FFFF 59 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0`\n\nBut let me count the bytes here:\n- E8 (1), four ??: positions2-5\n- C8 (6)\n- FF (7,8)\n- 75 (9,10)\n- 08 (11)\nWait, that's already too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different part of the instruction sequence. Maybe include the call and some following pushes or pops.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here, so perhaps I should focus on creating patterns based on specific instruction sequences from each trace without overlapping too much with others.\n\nAnother approach: for each pattern, select 2-3 instructions that are unique in their context. Then expand to include surrounding instructions to reach the length requirement.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1 (from Trace #2):\n85 C0 is a test on EAX.\nThen 0F84 is adding 0x4 to ESI (a common pattern).\nThen TEST EAX, 00000110h – that's the JZ instruction. So maybe:\n\n85C0 0F84 740A ?? ?? ??. Wait, no, in Trace #2, it's 64A0 after the test.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nIn Trace #2, after TEST EAX, 64A0 is pushed to the stack. So maybe Pattern1: `85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 ?? ...` but that's too short. Alternatively, include more instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps combining TEST with some pushes and a call:\n\nPattern1: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (from earlier)\n\nThat should be 12 bytes.\n\nPattern2: From Trace #3, the call is E8C8FFFF. After that, it's pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], which is FF7508. So maybe:\n\nE8C8FFFF FF7508 ?? ... but I need more context after that to make it 6-20 bytes.\n\nAlternatively, including the following instructions: after push comes 03C9 (pop ebp), then 5A is pushed again? Wait, no, in Trace #3:\n\nAfter E8C8FFFF call:\nFF7508 is pushed as dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nThen 03C9 pops ebp\nThen 5A is pushed (0F40)\nThen 8BCE movs to stack.\n\nSo maybe a pattern could be `E8C8FFFF FF7508 03C9 ?? 5A ...` – but I'm not sure. Maybe better to focus on the call and four bytes after it, then some context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nPattern2: `E8C8FFFF 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\nWait, that's combining the push (5A) before the call with the call itself and following instructions. But I need to include enough bytes for wildcards.\n\nI think it's better to create patterns based on specific instruction sequences without overlapping too much. So:\n\nPattern1: From Trace #2:\n85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 (push) ?? ??\n\nBut that might not be long enough. Alternatively, include more instructions after the push.\n\nAlternatively, combine TEST with some pushes and a call to create a longer pattern.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this, so let me try to draft the corrected YARA rule.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass based on stack displacement and specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 0F84 740A 64A0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 53 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFF FF7508 03C9 5A ?? 8BCE 85C0 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
