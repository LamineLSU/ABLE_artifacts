(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create three bypass patterns for this malware evasion. The goal is to help a defender bypass the detection by finding places where the attacker's checks are done and then creating patterns that can skip those checks.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided, it seems like there are multiple calls happening, which might be points where the attacker is checking if the call was made correctly or if certain conditions were met. My job is to identify potential bypass points by analyzing these calls and their surrounding instructions.\n\nI notice that the first few calls in the trace have some predictable patterns. For example, at line 00419F2B, there's a call to 00404DE4h. This might be an entry point check or a legitimate function call. If I can bypass this call without changing anything else, it could allow execution to continue.\n\nAnother area is around the call at 00419F6E to 00433D2Ch. The instruction before that has some XOR operations which might be checks for certain values in EAX or EBX registers. Bypassing these would mean modifying the operand so that the condition fails, thus allowing execution to proceed.\n\nThen, looking at the call at 00419F79 to 004A3B84h. This could be another legitimate function call with specific offset checks. Again, by altering an operand or skipping a check, I might find a way to bypass this.\n\nFor each of these points, I need to create patterns that can detect when the attacker is trying to check and then skip those checks. Using wildcards for address/offset bytes will make sure the pattern matches only at those specific locations without being too broad.\n\nI should also ensure that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long by combining multiple instructions around the target call. This way, it's precise enough to match only the intended location but flexible enough to adapt if there are slight variations in execution.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these patterns into three separate Yara rules with specific bypass actions for each target point.\n</think>\n\nHere is a structured and organized presentation of the thought process and final answer:\n\n---\n\n### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n   - The malware author likely implemented several checks to detect sandbox or VM evasion, such as verifying instruction sequences or register states before allowing execution.\n\n2. **Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n   - Identify potential bypass points where the attacker might have inserted checks.\n   - Each check could be a target for bypass by skipping specific instructions.\n\n3. **Adversarial Analysis**\n   - Analyze the trace data to locate calls that might represent legitimate functions or attacker checks.\n   - For each call, determine if it can be bypassed without altering core functionality.\n\n4. **Pattern Creation**\n   - Combine multiple consecutive instructions around identified target points into patterns.\n   - Use wildcards for address/offset bytes and keep opcode and register bytes concrete.\n\n5. **Validation**\n   - Ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, distinct from others, and accurately represents a bypass scenario.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting call checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 39 0C 00 ?? ?? ?? ??
