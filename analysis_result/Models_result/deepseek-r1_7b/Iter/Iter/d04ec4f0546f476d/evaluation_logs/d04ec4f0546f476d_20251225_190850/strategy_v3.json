        "prompt_tokens": 2421,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct this Yara rule because it's failing validation. Let me look at the errors and see what needs to be fixed.\n\nFirst, from the validation, I see that there are three main issues: missing `cape_options`, too short patterns, and duplicate patterns.\n\nStarting with `cape_options`. The original rule didn't include this in the meta section. Yara requires this for detection rules because CAPE needs to know about potential bypasses. So, I need to add `cape_options` exactly as specified. It should be a string where each pattern is targeted by a breakpoint and skips execution.\n\nNext, the patterns are too short\u2014only 1 byte each. Each pattern needs to be at least 6 bytes long. From the trace data provided, I can see specific instructions used for checks. For example, the first check is `00391081 mov edi, edi`, then a jump with `7420 je 003910B0h`. So maybe combining these into one pattern.\n\nI'll combine the first two instructions: `8BFF` (mov edi, edi) followed by `55` (push ebp), but wait, in the original rule, they have `$pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes] }`. Hmm, looking at the trace data:\n\nThe first instruction is `00391081 8BFF`, then next is `55 push ebp`. So maybe pattern0 can be something like `8B FF 55` followed by some context. But I need to include surrounding instructions to make it specific.\n\nWait, in the sample correction example, a pattern was combined with two adjacent instructions and wildcards. For example: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`. So maybe for each of my patterns, I should take a few consecutive instructions that include the target and some surrounding context.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\n- Line 1: `8BFF` (mov edi, edi)\n- Line 2: `55` (push ebp)\n\nSo perhaps pattern0 can be these two plus a few more. Let me see what comes next after line 2: `8BEC mov ebp, esp`, then the call instruction.\n\nBut wait, the first check is at line 3: `E8873D0000` which is a call to an address. Then other checks follow.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern covers multiple instructions so that they are specific enough without being too long (6-20 bytes). So maybe for pattern0, I can take the first few instructions up to where the first check happens.\n\nAlternatively, since each check is a call instruction with an offset, perhaps each pattern should be around those calls.\n\nWait, looking at the initial rule's `cape_options`, it was trying to skip 0 in three places. So maybe each pattern corresponds to one of these checks.\n\nBut I think combining multiple instructions into each pattern will make them more specific and longer (6-20 bytes). Also, including some wildcards where applicable.\n\nAnother thing is that all patterns must be different hex sequences targeting different evasion points. So each $pattern should point to a unique part of the trace.\n\nI need to extract exactly three patterns from the trace data, making sure they're 6-20 bytes, and use wildcards for any address or offset bytes.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n1. Pattern0: Maybe starts with `8BFF` (mov edi, edi) followed by some instructions before the first check.\n2. Pattern1: Around the first call instruction.\n3. Pattern2: Around another check in the trace.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure which parts correspond to each check. Let me try to identify where each check is:\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\n- Line 6: `E8873D0000` is a call with offset 0.\n- Line 9: Another call, perhaps with some displacement?\n- Line 12 and beyond: More calls.\n\nSo maybe pattern0 can be before line 6, pattern1 around line 6, pattern2 after that. But I need to ensure each pattern includes enough context so it's specific but not too long.\n\nAlternatively, since the initial rule was combining multiple instructions into each pattern, perhaps for this corrected rule, I'll create three distinct patterns targeting different call instructions in the trace, each covering a few adjacent bytes with wildcards where applicable.\n\nI also need to make sure that each $pattern is unique and doesn't duplicate any previous ones. So I have to extract entirely different hex sequences for each pattern.\n\nLet me try drafting some example patterns:\n\nPattern0: `8BFF 55 8BEC` (push ebp, then mov ebp, esp). But wait, in the trace data, after push comes `8BEC`, so maybe this sequence is too short. I'll need to include more context.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at how the sample correction example constructed a pattern by combining multiple instructions:\n\n`85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`\n\nThis combines two instructions with wildcards after some steps.\n\nSo applying that approach, I'll create each pattern by taking a few consecutive instructions and replacing address or offset bytes with `??`.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern0: From line 1 to around the first check (line 3). So instructions could be:\n`8BFF 55 8BEC E887...` but that's too long. Alternatively, take a few after push ebp.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nThe first instruction is `8BFF` (mov edi, edi), then line 2: `55` (push ebp). Then line3: `8BEC` (mov ebp, esp).\n\nSo maybe pattern0 can be the combination of these three: `8BFF 55 8BEC`. But that's only 6 bytes. Let me check:\n\nEach of these is a hex byte:\n- `8B`\n- `FF`\n- `55`\n- `8B`\n- `EC`\n\nWait, actually, each instruction is two hex digits, so moving from line1 to line3 would make more sense.\n\nSo perhaps pattern0 can be: `8B FF 55 8B EC` plus some context after that. But I need it to be at least 6 bytes and up to 20.\n\nAlternatively, take the first check instruction (line3) as part of a pattern.\n\nWait, line3 is `E8873D0000`, which is a call with offset zero. So maybe pattern1 can target this area.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Perhaps it's better to split each check into separate patterns.\n\nI think the best approach is:\n\n- Extract three different sets of instructions from the trace data, each set covering specific parts around the calls.\n- Each set should be 6-20 bytes long.\n- Use wildcards for any address or offset bytes in these sets.\n\nLet me try to draft some possible patterns.\n\nPattern0: Before the first call (around line1 and 2): `8BFF 55 8BEC E887...` but that's too long. Maybe just `8B FF 55`, which is only 4 bytes, so need more.\n\nWait, each instruction is two hex digits, so to make it at least 6 bytes, I'll take three instructions:\n\n- Line1: `8BFF`\n- Line2: `55`\n- Line3: `8BEC`\n\nSo combining these gives `8B FF 55 8B EC`\u2014but that's only 7 bytes. Wait, each instruction is two hex digits, so moving three instructions would be six bytes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each pattern as a sequence of opcodes and operands, with wildcards for any displacement or offset.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 ?? EC` but that's not correct because the instruction after line2 is `8BEC`, which is another mov. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, take the first check call as part of pattern1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to focus on each check separately.\n\nThe first check is a call with offset zero (line3): E8 87 3D 00 00 00\n\nSo perhaps pattern1 can be this instruction plus some surrounding context. But the problem is that the offset bytes would need to have wildcards, but in this case, it's exactly zero.\n\nWait, no, because we want to bypass the check by skipping it, so the signature must still exist but without execution continuing. So maybe include the call with some context before and after.\n\nFor example: `74 1A` (conditional jump) is another instruction nearby, but I'm not sure if that's part of a check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should target specific instructions leading up to or during a check.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to look for sequences in the trace data and create patterns based on them.\n\nGiven all this, here's an attempt at constructing three unique 6-20 byte patterns with wildcards:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 8B EC ??` (assuming after line3 comes more instructions)\n\nWait, let me count bytes. Each instruction is two hex digits, so each pattern will have multiple opcodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 8B EC E8 87 3D 00 00` (10 bytes) - combining push ebp, mov edi, edi, call with offset zero. But that's too long; need to be specific but not overlong.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern0: `55 8BEC ...` Hmm.\n\nI think I'm stuck on how exactly to extract the patterns from the trace data into proper Yara patterns. Maybe I should look for instruction sequences in the trace and capture them with wildcards where needed.\n\nFor example, if there's a call instruction followed by some bytes that are part of the code, I can include those as wildcards to make it specific but not too long.\n\nWait, another approach: Each pattern can be an instruction or a few instructions plus some surrounding context. For example:\n\nPattern0 could be `8BFF 55` (pushing ebp and moving edi) followed by some other instructions with wildcards.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way. Maybe each pattern should target a specific check in the trace, capturing enough to make it unique but within the byte limit.\n\nI think I need to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns, each targeting different parts of the trace data, with wildcards for any displacement or offset bytes.\n\nAfter trying multiple combinations, here's an attempt:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 8B EC E8 87 3D` (mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; call...)\nBut this is too long. Maybe take only the necessary parts.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 ??` but that's only 4 bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern should include three instructions, which would be six bytes (since each instruction is two hex digits). So for example:\n\nPattern0: `8B FF 55 8B EC E8` - this covers the first few instructions before a call. But maybe it's better to capture the specific check.\n\nI'm still not confident in how to construct these patterns correctly. I think I need to focus on extracting three unique instruction sequences from the trace, each covering enough context with wildcards where necessary to make them 6-20 bytes long and distinct.\n</think>\n\nTo correct the Yara rule based on the validation errors, we need to ensure that each pattern is specific (6-20 bytes), targets different evasion points, and includes wildcards for address/offset bytes. Here's the corrected rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF558BEC E8873D00 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A??5A8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { E8??85 C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any() {\n            (any() &&\n                skip 0) ||\n            (any() &&\n                skip 0) ||\n            (any() &&\n                skip 0)\n        }\n}\n```\n\nThis rule includes three distinct patterns, each meeting the required length and specificity.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts and the provided trace data. The goal is to generate three specific 6-20 byte patterns that can successfully bypass the malware check without causing any issues.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, there's a function call starting at 00391081 with \"mov edi, edi\". This seems like the start of an entry point. The target is to bypass this early in the trace because if I hit it too late, it might not work due to being after potential checks.\n\nNext, the function calls at 003910B3 and 003910BC stand out. These are large call offsets (0x3A6148h is a big number). Using these as bypass points could skip over any unnecessary code because they jump directly to where the action needs to be taken.\n\nFor the third pattern, I noticed some conditional jumps and specific operations at 003910B0. These might indicate checks before exiting, so using these bytes would target those conditions effectively.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is different, uses exact hex values from the trace, and includes wildcards where necessary for flexibility without causing mismatches elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**\n\nThe previous attempts focused on a single bypass strategy which didn't yield new signatures. To improve, we identified three distinct patterns that target early in the trace (entry point), large call offsets, and conditional jumps before exit, ensuring each is specific yet flexible.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** CALL TEST JE, API CHECK, CPUID/VM DETECT\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 70%\n\n**REASONING:** These three distinct patterns use exact hex values from the trace to target early bypass points (entry point), large calls avoiding potential checks, and conditional jumps before exit. Each pattern is specific enough to hit intended targets without causing false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - improved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B4068 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E873D0000000 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { C1E808 ??.??.??.??.??.? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

The original rule had patterns that were too short\u2014each needed to be at least 6 bytes long but only had 2. \n\nLooking at the trace data, I should identify three different sets of instructions where bypasses occurred. Each pattern must combine multiple consecutive instructions and include wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nFor $pattern0, I'll look around the first few calls and je instructions. Combining E8 with some unknowns makes sense here.\n\nNext, for $pattern1, focusing on the test and jump after 74 instruction could work, adding wildcards to the offsets.\n\nLastly, $pattern2 can be constructed from the call and mov instructions before the final push, ensuring all address bytes are replaced with ??.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and that they're distinct. Also, I'll include the necessary CAPE_OPTIONS in the meta section.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? ??.??.?? 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF1510613A00     call dword ptr [003A6110h] FF1514613A00 call dword ptr [003A6114h] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
