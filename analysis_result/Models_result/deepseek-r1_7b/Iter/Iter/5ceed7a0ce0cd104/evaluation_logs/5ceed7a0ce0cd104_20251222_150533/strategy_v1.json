Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace and previous attempts. The goal is to create an improved rule that can successfully bypass the malware checks in the given sample.\n\nFirst, looking at the current best rule, it's empty because no new signatures were found. The latest attempt failed with an error message about generating a YARA rule. So I need to figure out what patterns could be causing this and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe trace provided has two instances of ExitProcess at 0041B93C. Each trace shows several calls and operations before reaching the exit point. My task is to identify bypass strategies based on these traces.\n\nLooking at Strategy A: Evasion Check. It suggests looking in the first 30% of the trace for a call, followed by a test on EAX with a jump if not equal. Strategy B is about finding conditional checks before an exit, which might involve something like a JE or JNE instruction before the exit.\n\nIn the provided traces, after the initial setup (push ebp, mov edi, etc.), there's a call to some function at 0041DF02h, followed by checking EAX with test al, 01h. Then it either jumps based on EAX or continues executing.\n\nSo for Strategy A, maybe I can look for the sequence: CALL, TEST EAX, JE/JNE. That could be a target to bypass early in the trace before any potential exit decisions.\n\nFor Strategy B, perhaps there's a condition checked after the initial setup but before the exit call that we can exploit. Maybe something like a conditional jump or check on another register.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts. The patterns must be specific enough to hit the target without being too broad.\n\nLooking at the trace, after the call to 0041DF02h (which I assume is some check function), there's a test on EAX: C1E8 shr eax, 08h followed by A801 test al, 01h. Then either jne or je based on EAX.\n\nSo maybe one pattern could be the sequence from the call to the test on EAX with specific offsets. Another pattern could involve checking another register before exiting, perhaps something similar but using a different offset or instruction.\n\nI should also consider the structure of YARA rules and how these patterns would translate into conditions in the rule.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll extract three distinct 6-10 byte patterns from the trace that fit either Strategy A or B. Each pattern will be specific to certain instructions with exact hex values where possible.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: Based on the provided traces and strategies, the analysis identified two key areas for bypass: an evasion check early in the trace and a conditional check before exit. Patterns from these areas are extracted into specific 6-10 byte sequences.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns focus on specific instruction sequences that bypass the malware checks by either evading an early test or exploiting a conditional check before exit. These are targeted to avoid false positives and ensure effective bypass.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC } -- Specific test on EAX\n        $pattern1 = { C1E808A801 } -- Conditional check before exit\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508F14200 } -- Conditional call bypass\n\n    condition:\n        (any of them)\n}\n```",
