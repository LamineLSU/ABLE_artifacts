(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this malware trace that's causing it to exit early due to sandbox evasion. The goal is to find bypass points for a defense analysis. Let me start by looking at the provided trace data and trying to understand what's happening.\n\nFirst, the trace starts with an exitProcess instruction at 0041E22F. Then there are several function calls, some loops pushing registers onto the stack, and other operations. I see multiple call instructions, which probably mean the malware is making API calls or something similar that might trigger detection in a sandbox.\n\nLooking closer, after each call (like FFD2), there's a pop instruction followed by ret, except for one instance where it directly returns. This might indicate conditional execution based on some checks done during evasion.\n\nI notice that the code has loops pushing registers like push ecx and push eax multiple times before calling functions. Maybe these are used to check for detection mechanisms in the sandbox or VM.\n\nIn Phase 1 (attacker's perspective), I think the malware author implemented several checks, such as checking if certain registers have been modified by the user or not. For example, if a register was pushed too many times without being popped correctly, it might trigger an exit instead of allowing execution to continue.\n\nPhase 2 is about how a defender would bypass these checks. The critical points are where the attacker's code does something based on certain conditions. If I can make those conditions fail or skip over them, the malware could proceed normally and not exit early.\n\nFor each potential bypass point, if skipping an instruction neutralizes or fails the check, that becomes a target. For example, if after pushing registers several times, skipping one of the pop instructions might bypass the detection because it's expecting more pops than are actually happening.\n\nIn Phase 3, I need to evaluate how robust these bypasses are. Would the attacker easily detect them? Do they affect legitimate code?\n\nFor Phase 4, I'll choose three different bypass points based on where the checks occur in the trace:\n\n1. After a certain number of register pushes and pops, skipping one instruction would prevent the exit.\n2. Skipping an unconditional jump or a conditional that doesn't match might allow execution to continue past detection.\n3. Bypassing a memory access check by not performing it after a call.\n\nEach of these will form different patterns in Phase 5. I'll need to combine multiple instructions into each pattern, ensuring they're 6-20 bytes long and using wildcards where necessary for address or offset bytes.\n\nI should make sure that each pattern is unique and covers specific points in the trace where evasion checks are implemented. By creating these patterns, defenders can identify when the malware is trying to bypass such checks and act accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo analyze this malware trace with a focus on identifying potential bypass points, we'll follow a structured approach combining both attacker's and defender's perspectives.\n\n### Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)\n\nThe malware likely implemented several evasion mechanisms during execution. Observing the trace:\n\n- **Check 1**: Multiple register pushes followed by pops might be intended to verify if registers have been tampered with.\n- **Check 2**: The call instruction FFD2 could be checking for a specific condition, such as whether an argument was properly set before calling.\n- **Check 3**: The presence of multiple push and pop operations suggests a check on register state.\n\n### Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)\n\nTo bypass the evasion:\n\n1. Skipping one unnecessary push/pop operation might neutralize or bypass the initial checks, as excessive register manipulation could trigger an exit.\n2. Bypassing an unconditional call (like E8740A0000) if it doesn't match expected parameters can allow execution to proceed without triggering detection.\n3. Overlooking a specific instruction after a memory access operation might prevent unwanted behavior and bypass checks.\n\n### Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis\n\nEach bypass strategy's robustness is considered:\n- The attacker may detect or counteract these bypasses with additional checks, making them less effective against legitimate code but potentially more noticeable.\n- Specificity of each pattern reduces likelihood of false positives in detection tools, though they should still be general enough to avoid broad issues.\n\n### Phase 4: Bypass Patterns\n\nThree distinct bypass patterns are crafted based on identified critical points:\n\n1. **Pattern Targeting Register Pushes and Pops**  \n   Combines multiple push/pop operations with a skipped instruction to bypass initial checks:\n   ```\n   {8B550C 5E pop esi 5D pop ebp 50 push eax 56 push esi}\n   ```\n\n2. **Skipping Unconditional Call**  \n   Targets a call that doesn't match expected parameters, allowing execution to continue undetected:\n   ```\n   {8B4510 E8740A0000 call eax ?? ??.??}\n   ```\n\n3. **Overlooking Memory Access Check**  \n   Focuses on bypassing an instruction after a memory access operation to prevent unwanted side effects:\n   ```\n   {6A00 push 00000000h 8B4510 mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+10h] ??}\n   ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```yara\nrule Evasion_Bypass_Patterns {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {8B550C 5E pop esi 5D pop ebp 50 push eax 56 push esi}\n        $pattern1 = {8B4510 E8740A0000 call eax ?? ??.??}\n        $pattern2 = {6A00 push 00000000h 8B4510 mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+10h] ??}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help improve a YARA bypass rule based on some trace analysis. The original rule had no new signatures after being hit, which suggests that the previous pattern matched but didn't work effectively in this case. \n\nFirst, let me look at the trace provided. It seems like there's a lot of mov and call instructions, especially around the call to 0041EB27h. There are multiple instances where the code is calling this function, which might indicate that it's part of an exit process or something similar.\n\nSince the previous attempts used strategies A and B but didn't yield new signatures, I need to think about alternative approaches. Strategy C involved using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID, but those might be too specific and not present in this trace. \n\nLooking at the trace again, there are several places where a mov instruction is followed by a call. For example, lines 0041E1AF have a push on edx and then a call to 0041EB27h. This seems like a potential point for bypass because it's a conditional check before exiting.\n\nI notice that the function being called (0041EB27h) is likely related to exiting, so maybe bypassing this would work. I can look for patterns where the code pushes some registers and then calls this function. \n\nAnother thought: sometimes exit processes have preconditions that need to be checked before termination. If the function call isn't unconditional, bypassing it could prevent the exit. So perhaps I should find a conditional check right before the call.\n\nI also see that there are multiple mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+08h] instructions around 0041E1CA-0041E1CD. These might be setting up some registers for the function call. Maybe bypassing these moves would prevent the exit.\n\nPutting this together, I can create a pattern that includes pushing ebp and esp (like in lines 0041E1D0) followed by the mov instructions and then the call to 0041EB27h. This seems like an effective point because it's right before the exit process, and bypassing it would stop the exit.\n\nSo, my three patterns should each target different parts of this sequence but all around the call to 0041EB27h. I'll make sure each pattern is unique and specific enough by using exact hex values from the trace where possible.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original bypass rule was hitting a conditional check before the exit process (Strategy B). By focusing on the specific sequence of pushes and calls to 0041EB27h, we target an earlier decision point that can be bypassed more effectively. This approach avoids potential issues with later exits or generic patterns.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**REASONING**: Targeting the function call right before the exit allows bypassing a specific conditional check, potentially preventing termination and evading detection.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specifically targeting function calls before exit\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0041E1D0--push esi\n                       8B5514 mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+14h]\n                       8B5514 mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+14h]\n                       E8740A0000 call 0041EB27h }\n        $pattern1 = { 0041E1D5--push ecx\n                       8DB0980C0000 lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000C98h]\n                       8DB0980C0000 lea esi, dword ptr [eax+00000C98h] }\n        $pattern2 = { 0041E1EC--add esp\n                       83C414 add esp, 14h }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
