(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct the YARA rule based on the provided information. The user has already analyzed the problem and given some structure for the solution. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original invalid rule, it's clear that there are three patterns: $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2. Each of these represents a different part of the code where bypass might occur.\n\nThe validation error mentioned was about the generic pattern being too specific and not triggering new signatures. The advice was to add four context bytes after the CALL instruction. So, I need to make sure that each pattern includes this context.\n\nIn the previous attempt, $pattern0 was 85 C0 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8D 43 01. Wait, but looking at the trace data, the call is at address FF152CA1D900, which in the strings section is represented as $pattern1: FF 15 2CA1 D900. So maybe $pattern0 should include some of that context.\n\nBut the user provided a corrected example where each pattern is made up of multiple instructions with wildcards. For instance, the example has 85 C0 followed by ?? and so on. I think the correct approach is to take consecutive instructions from the trace data and combine them into patterns with wildcards for addresses.\n\nSo, starting with $pattern0: The first instruction in the bypass path is a JE 00D96190h (74 15), which could be followed by some push or pop operations. But according to the corrected example, it's better to take multiple instructions that form a sequence.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nAt address FF152CA1D900: call dword ptr [00D988Ch], so this is likely $pattern1.\n\nAnother bypass point could be earlier in the code. For instance, an instruction like 74 15 (JE) followed by a push or something else. So combining 74 15 with some surrounding instructions and wildcards would form $pattern0.\n\nFor $pattern2, it might include another part of the code where bypass is possible, perhaps after more operations.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long. The example given was 11 bytes for a similar pattern, so I can follow that as a reference.\n\nLet me try constructing each pattern:\n\n$pattern0: Maybe start with JE (74) and the following instruction which is a push (8B). So something like 74 ?? followed by 8B and some wildcards. But looking at the example provided in the validation, it's better to include more consecutive instructions.\n\nWait, the corrected example given was:\n\n$pattern0 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nWhich is a series of instructions including PUSH (6A), POP (5A), MOV (8B), etc. So perhaps I can follow that structure.\n\nFor $pattern1, since it's the call at FF152CA1D900, maybe I can include that instruction and some surrounding context. For example, the CALL itself is E8 2CA1 D900, so adding four wildcards after it to get around the offset.\n\nSo $pattern1 could be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? followed by other instructions like 83 C4 (JZ) and then more instructions including 85 C0.\n\nWait, but in the trace data, there's another call at FF1624E9AEB which is part of a different pattern. Maybe $pattern2 should include that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n$pattern0: A sequence starting with a conditional jump (74) and then some operations like push, pop, etc., combined with wildcards.\n$pattern1: The call instruction at FF152CA1D900 followed by four wildcards to bypass the offset.\n$pattern2: Another part of the code where bypass is possible, perhaps involving a different instruction sequence.\n\nI think I have all the pieces now. Each pattern must be exactly 6-20 bytes, include instructions from the trace data with appropriate wildcards, and ensure that each is unique.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 74 ?? 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 2CA1 D900 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to correct the Yara rule based on the given instructions and the previous invalid attempt. Let me start by understanding what's wrong with the original rule.\n\nThe original rule had missing basic structure\u2014no meta section with description or cape options, and only two string patterns instead of three. The strings were too short (like 10 hex bytes) which is below the required 6-20 bytes per pattern. Also, the wildcard usage wasn't consistent; some address bytes weren't replaced.\n\nFirst, I need to add a proper meta section with description and cape_options. The rule should have three different string patterns, each between 6-20 bytes long. All address/offset bytes must be replaced with '??' except for opcode and register bytes which should stay concrete.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can extract instructions that form contiguous sequences suitable for patterns. Each pattern should target a specific instruction where the attacker's code is checked.\n\nFor $pattern0, let me pick an early instruction in the trace: 85 C0 (TEST EAX), followed by some conditional jumps and memory accesses with wildcards. So something like TEST, JZ, MOV, etc., but making sure to include enough context bytes after CALL or JMP for detection.\n\n$pattern1 can be a longer sequence involving more address and offset bytes, ensuring they're all replaced with '??'.\n\nFor $pattern2, I'll select another instruction from the trace, maybe E8 ?? which is part of an instruction without specific bytes that need to stay concrete.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern has exactly 6-20 bytes. After forming these patterns, I should validate them by checking if they include all required parts and fit within the byte limit.\n\nFinally, compiling the meta section with the correct cape_options string, ensuring it references each pattern correctly.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace and feedback from previous attempts. The current best rule has a confidence of 50% but still hits the same locations without adding new signatures.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, I need to identify potential patterns that could be used for bypassing. The strategies mentioned are EVASION CHECK (60% success), EXIT DECISION (25%), and EVASION TECHNIQUE (15%). Since previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, maybe focusing on more specific patterns from the trace would help.\n\nLooking at Strategy A, which is the EVASION CHECK with a 60% success rate. It looks for the first 30% of the trace where there's a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. I should check if this area in the trace can be used more effectively without causing issues.\n\nLooking at the trace, around address 00D9617A, there's a test eax instruction following a call. Maybe this is a good candidate for pattern matching. The idea would be to target this early point so it doesn't interfere with other parts of the process.\n\nFor Strategy B, the EXIT DECISION involves checking before the exit call. That might require looking at more specific patterns near the end of the trace where ExitProcess or similar calls are happening. However, since previous attempts didn't find new signatures, maybe this area is too risky if not handled carefully with specific instructions.\n\nStrategy C suggests using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection. These might be more complex and less common, but given that the current rule is hitting without adding signatures, perhaps these patterns can offer a different approach.\n\nI need to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns based on existing trace data. Each pattern should use specific bytes from the trace where possible and wildcards for varying offsets or addresses.\n\nFor the first pattern, I'll target the initial test eax after a call, as it's an early point in the trace and might be predictable:\n- Pattern 1: {85C00F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45FC} which would match a call followed by test eax, then mov.\n\nPattern 2 could focus on another section where there's a conditional jump before an exit. For example, at address 00D961A7, there's an add and then a jmp with specific conditions:\n- Pattern 2: {5B ?? ?? ?? ?? EB03} which might target the jmp instruction.\n\nPattern 3 could be looking for specific comparison instructions towards the end of the trace. At address 00D96204, there's a lea and mov based on ebp offsets:\n- Pattern 3: {8D4301 ?? ?? ?? ?? 5F} which would match a cmp instruction with specific values.\n\nEach pattern uses wildcards for varying parts to ensure specificity without being too broad. These patterns should be placed in areas that are likely to bypass without causing issues, thus increasing the success rate.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The current rule is hitting the same locations but not providing new signatures. To improve, we'll target specific early calls and conditional jumps in the trace for more effective bypass points.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, Conditional_Jump, Comparison\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 60%\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are chosen to bypass at specific predictable locations without causing false positives. The first pattern targets an initial test after a call, the second focuses on conditional jumps before exits, and the third looks for comparison operations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific early calls and conditional jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C00F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 5B ?? ?? ?? ??
