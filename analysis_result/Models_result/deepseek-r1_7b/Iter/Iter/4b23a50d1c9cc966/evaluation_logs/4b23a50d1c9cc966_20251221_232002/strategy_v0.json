        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this YARA rule because it's not working properly. The main issues are that each pattern is too short and there are only two instead of three required. Let me look at the trace data provided to find suitable patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace, I see multiple instructions after E8F7250000. Maybe I can combine a few consecutive instructions into each pattern. Also, I need to include enough context so that the patterns are specific and not too short.\n\nFor the first pattern ($pattern0), let's look around the E8F7250000 call instruction. It's followed by 83F801 cmp eax, 01h, then 7420 je. Combining these might create a longer pattern. So I can take E8F7250000 and the next few instructions.\n\nPattern0: E8 F7 25 00 00 ... Hmm, wait, maybe it's better to include more bytes around the call. Let me count:\n\nE8F7250000 (1 byte) + 83F801 (4 bytes) + 7420 (2 bytes). That's already 7 bytes. Maybe I can add a few more from after that.\n\nLooking further, after je, there are some mov and call instructions. Let me try to capture a longer sequence without including unnecessary data.\n\nPattern1: E8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 74 20 ... Wait, but I need only 6-20 bytes. Maybe take E8F7250000 and the next few instructions that are unique.\n\nPattern2: Maybe from another part of the trace where evasions occur. Looking at the second trace line, there's a call to F13Ch after some mov and shr. So maybe capture those instructions.\n\nI also need to replace all address or offset bytes with ?? as per wildcard rules. So wherever I see an address like 0030h in the first trace, it should become ??. Same for stack offsets in calls.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPattern0: E8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 (this is 9 bytes, which is within the limit).\n\nPattern1: Maybe from another call, like FF153CF14200 after some mov and shr. So take FF 15 3C ... etc., but need to make sure it's unique.\n\nWait, looking at the first part of the trace:\n\n- E8F7250000\n- 8B4068 mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]\n- C1E8 shr eax, 08h\n- A801 test al, 01h\n- 7510 jne ...\n\nSo maybe Pattern1 can be the sequence from E8F7250000 to A801.\n\nPattern1: E8 F7 25 00 00 8B 40 68 C1 E8 A8 01. That's 13 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\nFor Pattern2, looking at the second trace:\n\n- FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n- FF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]\n- E80B000000 call 0041B943h\n\nWait, maybe take the call to F13Ch and include some surrounding instructions.\n\nPattern2: FF 75 08 50 (push) FF 15 3C ... But I need a unique sequence. Let's capture from FF7508 onwards for around 6-20 bytes.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each pattern is different and includes wildcards where necessary.\n</think>\n\nTo correct the YARA rule, we'll generate three specific patterns based on the provided trace data, ensuring each is 6-20 bytes long with wildcard replacements as needed. Each pattern will target unique evasions from the traces.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 08 50 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]) FF 15 3C ... } \n        $pattern2 = { FF 75 08 E8 0B ... }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Each pattern is created by combining consecutive instructions, ensuring they are specific enough to target the evasion points while being long enough (6-20 bytes).
