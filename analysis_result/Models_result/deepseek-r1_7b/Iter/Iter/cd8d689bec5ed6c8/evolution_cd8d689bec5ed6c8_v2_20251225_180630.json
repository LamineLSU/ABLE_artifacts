      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help analyze this malware evasion bypass trace. The user has provided four traces where the exit process is being bypassed at different addresses (002F61F8, 011661F8, 0040E7F6, and 0040E7FF). My task is to figure out how to create Yara rules that can detect these evasion attempts.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the provided traces. Each trace ends with an ExitProcess call, but in each case, there's a specific address where the bypass happens before exiting. The goal is to find patterns that indicate the program is trying to exit but instead gets intercepted or bypassed.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, the exit process is called from 002F61F8 via a call to 002FA12Ch. I notice that there's a lot of pushing and popping on the stack, some XOR operations, memory accesses, and jumps between different sections (like ebp, eax). The code also has several mov instructions into local variables like 00000104h and 00000108h.\n\nIn TRACE #2, similar patterns exist but with different addresses. There's a push of 00000040h, which is 65 bytes in decimal or 0x040h. This might indicate an offset being used for stack manipulation.\n\nTRACE #3 and #4 differ slightly in their call addresses (0040E7C3h vs. 0040E7FF). The initial part of the trace involves moving ebp to esp, pushing some data onto the stack with FF7508, which is a constant used for aligning larger structures.\n\nNow, considering how Yara rules work, I need to construct patterns that capture these specific behaviors. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards where necessary (like for addresses or offsets). The key is to find the exact sequence of instructions that lead to bypassing ExitProcess.\n\nFor each trace, I'll identify a critical instruction that's part of the bypass mechanism. For example, in TRACE #1, after the call at 002F61F8, there might be some stack manipulation or memory access that needs to be captured.\n\nI should also consider what happens before and after these instructions. Including context bytes around them can help avoid false positives. For instance, if a push or pop is part of normal code, it shouldn't trigger the bypass unless it's followed by specific behavior like a call or a test/jump.\n\nAnother important aspect is making sure that each pattern doesn't overlap with others and covers different parts of the code to increase detection coverage without increasing false positives. Maybe using different instruction sequences for each trace would help achieve this.\n\nI also need to ensure that all address/offset bytes are replaced with wildcards (??) as per the rules, while keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete. This way, the patterns become specific enough to match only the target locations but broad enough to cover similar evasions.\n\nFinally, I'll structure each pattern to include 2-3 consecutive instructions, making sure they fit within the 6-20 byte requirement. Each pattern should clearly indicate a bypass attempt by showing the sequence that leads away from the normal exit path.\n</think>\n\nTo create Yara rules for detecting these evasion bypass patterns, we analyze the provided traces and identify critical instruction sequences leading to ExitProcess exits.\n\n### Yara Rule Patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection using multiple patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? } # Includes TEST EAX, JZ, and MOV patterns\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 } # PUSH, POP, MOV, CALL sequences\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 8B EC FF C8 ???? ???? ???? ???? 8B EC FF FF15 AC B041 } # Memory accesses and stack manipulation\n}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace data and some previous attempts. Let me see what information I have and how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, from the \"Evolution History,\" there was an attempt where the rule hit but didn't find any new signatures. The current best rule is empty, which means the last attempt didn't work well. I need to figure out why that happened and improve upon it.\n\nLooking at the trace data for TRAC #1, there are several calls like \"call 002F667Fh\" and \"call 002F5C17h\". These seem important because bypass rules often target these exit points. The initial pattern in iteration 1 was probably looking too broad or didn't match specific conditions.\n\nI remember the key principles mentioned: learn from failures, use momentum if a strategy is working, and be specific but not too generic. So maybe I should focus on more specific patterns that were previously tried but didn't work.\n\nThe strategies suggested are A, B, and C. Strategy A targets the first 30% of the trace with a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. Strategy B looks before the exit decision, which might involve conditional checks or other logic before the exit call.\n\nIn the initial attempt, maybe the pattern was too broad or didn't account for specific conditions after the calls. For example, if there's a conditional like JE or JG that comes after the call to 002F667Fh, then just looking for the call might not work because it requires matching the condition as well.\n\nI need to find patterns from the trace data that include both the call and the conditional. Let me check the trace again. After \"call 002F667Fh\", there are several test and je instructions, like at 002F6183 E825050000 which is a call followed by \"je 002F5E83h\". Maybe the pattern should include both the call and the je.\n\nLooking further, at 002F61A3 there's another test eax, but that might be part of a different strategy. I need to focus on the specific calls that precede the exits.\n\nAnother approach is to look for RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detect as in Strategy C, but those are less likely since the initial attempt didn't find any new signatures, so maybe it's not about detection but bypassing the exit logic.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem was that the initial pattern matched too early or too late. If I can make the patterns more specific to certain parts of the trace where they're known to be used, like right before the exit calls with specific conditions.\n\nFor example, looking at the first call: 002F6183 E825050000 which is a call followed by \"je 002F5E83h\". The je instruction is at 002F5E83h. Maybe I can create a pattern that includes the call, then the specific je condition.\n\nAnother part of the trace has \"call 002F5C17h\" followed by various operations and then \"je 002F619A\". So perhaps another pattern could include this call and its subsequent je.\n\nI should also check if there are any RDTSC or CPUID instructions in these traces that might be used for bypass, but since the initial rule didn't match anything new, maybe those weren't present.\n\nSo, to make it specific, I can create patterns that look for these specific calls followed by their respective je instructions with concrete offsets. That way, the pattern won't match anywhere else unless it's at the correct location in the trace.\n\nLet me outline three possible patterns:\n\n1. The first call (002F6183 E825050000) followed by \"je 002F5E83h\".\n2. Another call (002F61A7 0F8433FDFFFF) followed by \"je 002F5E9Ah\".\n3. A third call (002F61C5 5A) with a specific operation before the je.\n\nEach of these should be translated into yara patterns using exact hex values and wildcards where necessary. This specificity should help in matching only at the right exit points, thus bypassing them effectively without causing issues elsewhere.\n</think>\n\nTo address the issue of creating an improved YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace data, we'll focus on specific patterns that were previously identified as potential entry points for bypass attempts. These patterns will be designed to target known exit calls with their corresponding conditional jumps.\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe initial attempt likely matched too broadly or didn't account for specific conditions after the calls, such as the conditional jumps (JE/JNE). By targeting these specific call locations followed by their respective conditionals, we can create more precise patterns that bypass only at the correct points in the trace.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns specifically target known exit calls with their conditional jumps (JE) from the trace. By ensuring specific hex values are used, we reduce false positives and improve bypass efficiency.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting specific exit calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [8B 45 FC 83 F8 74 12 8B 4D F8] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6A 5B 8B 4F E8 25 05 00 00] }\n        $pattern2 = { [5A 0F 84 33 FD FFFF 8E B8 4D] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThis rule specifically targets three known exit calls in the trace, each followed by a conditional jump. The use of exact hex values ensures specificity and reduces false positives.",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and feedback. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the iteration history, both attempts resulted in a \"Rule hit but no new signatures,\" which means the current patterns aren't working as expected. So, I need to figure out why and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe original trace shows several calls like call dword ptr [002F1680h], call dword ptr [002FA12Ch], etc., with various test and je instructions. The bypass attempts are likely checking these points for evasions or exit conditions.\n\nSince the last attempt used a pattern of 70 confidence, which didn't hit anything new, I should look elsewhere in the trace. Maybe other parts have unique instruction sequences that weren't matched before.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can extract various hex patterns:\n\n1. The first call is to dword ptr [002F1680h]. If I take a specific part of this call, like the test eax, eax and je 002F5E83h, maybe that's too generic.\n\nWait, let me look for more unique sequences. There are several jmp instructions with different offsets: 0x000000174, 0x00000029A, etc. Perhaps these can be used as bypass points because they're less common and might indicate evasions.\n\nAnother approach is to look for conditional jumps or specific comparisons before the exit calls. For example, maybe there's a cmp eax, imm32 followed by jb or jne.\n\nWait, in the trace, I see mov esp, ebp at 0x01165D9F and then ret. That might be an exit point, so perhaps targeting that with specific conditions could work.\n\nLet me try to create three distinct patterns based on these observations:\n\n1. A conditional jump before the exit decision, using a specific offset.\n2. An instruction sequence involving cmp and a jump condition after a specific comparison.\n3. Another unique instruction pattern that's not been tried yet.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards for address/offsets where necessary to avoid matching wrong locations. Also, each should be specific enough to target the intended bypass points without being too generic.\n\nAfter creating these patterns, I'll set their confidence based on how specific they are in the trace. Higher confidence means more specific hex sequences from the trace.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts used patterns that were either too broad or matched at incorrect locations within the trace. By focusing on unique instruction sequences and conditional jumps before exit points, we can create bypass strategies that are more effective.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | RDTSC Timing\n\n**REASONING**: Extracting specific hex patterns from the trace to target unique locations where evasions or exit conditions occur. These patterns ensure higher specificity without matching incorrect program flows.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeting conditional jumps before exit decisions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5B 74 0F 84 00 5A }\n        $pattern2 = { 50 8C 01 31 5E 9B 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
