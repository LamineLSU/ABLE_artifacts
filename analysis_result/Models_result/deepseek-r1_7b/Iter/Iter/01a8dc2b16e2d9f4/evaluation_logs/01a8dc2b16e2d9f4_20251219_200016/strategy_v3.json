(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem step by step. So, the user provided some traces from different runtimes and wants me to create a Yara rule based on these evasion bypasses. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on in each trace. Looking at the first few traces, it seems like they're all starting with mov edi, edi and then pushing ebp onto the stack. Each trace has different jump targets but some common instructions.\n\nThe user mentioned a strategy involving three phases: attacker's perspective, defender's analysis, and adversarial game analysis. I think for creating a Yara rule, focusing on the attacker's evasion is key because that's what we're trying to bypass.\n\nLooking at the first trace, the attacker calls 0040E7C3h via E8C8FFFFFF. The second trace does something similar but with 0041B0ACh. These are different addresses, so maybe the malware author is using a lookup table or some kind of function pointer.\n\nIn the third and fourth traces, there's a call to E8C8FFFFFF again, while in the fifth, it jumps directly to FF15ACB04100. So, perhaps these are different functions being called based on certain conditions. \n\nLooking at phase 2 from the strategy, as a defender, I need to find where the attacker can be bypassed. The key is to identify instructions that if skipped, would allow bypassing the check.\n\nIn the third trace, after E8C8FFFFFF, the next instruction is FF15ACB04100, which seems like it's another call. So maybe this is a function pointer lookup. If I can skip the call and jump directly to the target address, that would bypass the check.\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth trace, after E8C8FFFFFF, there's another call to FF15ACB04100. So perhaps both these calls are part of a function pointer table or some kind of lookup mechanism.\n\nWait, looking at the fifth trace, it directly jumps to FF158CE12700 without calling anything else before that. Maybe this is an alternative path when certain conditions aren't met earlier in the code.\n\nSo maybe there's a conditional jump here where if a check fails (like EAX == 0x01h), then instead of proceeding normally, it jumps to FF158CE12700. But since we're trying to bypass, perhaps skipping that condition and jumping directly would work.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third trace: after E8C8FFFFFF, there's a call to 0041B0ACh, which is another address. So if I can skip that call and jump directly, it might bypass the check.\n\nSo focusing on these calls as potential bypass points. Maybe each of these target addresses corresponds to different code paths or functions being called based on certain conditions in the malware's execution.\n\nNow, thinking about how Yara rules work: we need patterns that match when the instruction at a certain offset is skipped and jumps directly to the target address. \n\nSo for example, if there's an instruction like call dword ptr [some_offset], but we can skip this and jump directly to the target. In Yara, that would involve matching the opcode (E8) followed by the operand in a way that allows us to replace it with a jump.\n\nLooking at the third trace: after E8C8FFFFFF comes 0041B0ACh as an argument. So the instruction is E8 C8 FFFF, but wait no\u2014E8C8FFFFF would be the call. But in the trace, it's E8C8FFFFFF which is a call to [0040E7C3h] and then another call elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the hex addresses here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the third trace:\n- The call is 0040E7C3h via E8C8FFFFFF.\n- Then it calls FF15ACB04100 at address 0026A9DC.\n\nSo maybe these are two separate function pointers being called. So perhaps after the first function call, another one is made which leads to a different code path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the fifth trace:\n- After E8C8FFFFFF (which is a function pointer call), it directly jumps to FF158CE12700 without any intermediate steps. That might indicate that under certain conditions, instead of proceeding normally, it takes this direct jump.\n\nSo perhaps in some cases, after checking a condition and failing, the code skips to an alternative path by jumping over the usual function calls.\n\nIf I can create patterns where these jumps are replaced with direct jumps to the target address, bypassing the function pointer lookup, that might work.\n\nSo for each of these potential bypass points:\n\n1. After E8C8FFFFFF, jump directly to 0040E7C3h or similar.\n2. After another call (like in the third and fourth traces), skip it and jump to FF15ACB04100.\n3. In some cases, after a condition fails, jump directly to FF158CE12700.\n\nNow, translating this into Yara patterns with wildcards:\n\nFor the first bypass, perhaps we can capture E8 followed by C8FFFFF (the call), and replace it with a direct jump. So something like 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 which would match the TEST EAX + JZ + MOV pattern.\n\nBut looking at the third trace, after E8C8FFFFFF, the next instruction is FF15ACB04100 as a call to [0027E13Ch]. So maybe we can capture that and replace it with a direct jump to 0027E13Ch.\n\nSimilarly, in some traces, there's an E8 followed by another instruction. So perhaps replacing the call with a direct jump would bypass that check.\n\nSo I think creating three patterns where each skips a function pointer call or jumps directly to a target address could work as evasion tactics.\n\nNow, for Yara rules, each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary. Let me draft these:\n\n1. Pattern 1: Skipping E8C8FFFFF and jumping to 0040E7C3h.\n   - Instructions would be something like E8 C8 FFFF FF ... but instead of that, just the jump.\n\n2. Pattern 2: Skipping a call to another function pointer (like in third and fourth traces) by replacing it with a direct jump.\n\n3. Pattern 3: Skipping an EAX == 0x01h check and jumping directly to FF158CE12700.\n\nEach pattern should be constructed carefully, keeping opcodes concrete and using wildcards for any address or offset bytes.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Traces**\n\nI examined each trace to identify common instructions and potential evasion points. The traces show multiple function pointer calls (E8C8FFFFF) leading to different addresses, suggesting a lookup table or function pointer mechanism.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Bypass Points**\n\nIn some traces, after calling E8C8FFFFF, the code jumps directly to another address without intermediate steps. These points are potential bypass opportunities.\n\n**Step 3: Create Patterns**\n\nI crafted three patterns targeting these bypass points:\n1. Skipping a call to 0040E7C3h by jumping directly.\n2. Skipping calls leading to FF15ACB04100 and FF158CE12700.\n3. Bypassing an EAX check by jumping to FF158CE12700.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Wildcards**\n\nAll address/offset bytes are replaced with `??` to maintain specificity without exact addresses, while keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule bypass_function_ptr_bypass {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass of function pointer lookups\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 } # Skips EAX check and jumps to target\n        $pattern1 = { FF C8 FFFF FF ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 } # Skips function pointer call\n        $pattern2 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??.??.??.??.??.??.??.?? 8B 45 } # Jumps directly to target address\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
