(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create three different bypass patterns for this malware trace based on the given instructions. Let me start by understanding what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the trace data, there are several call instructions that might be part of the attacker's evasion tactics. The goal is to find where these calls can be skipped or manipulated without triggering an exit, thus bypassing the sandbox.\n\nFirst, I'll identify potential points where the code makes decisions that could allow bypass. Each call instruction (like E8431C0000, E8EE82FFFF, etc.) might have a conditional check before execution. If these checks are bypassed or skipped, it can lead to the continuation of the trace without exiting.\n\nI notice that after each call, there's often an E8 instruction followed by a test on EAX (like 85C0). These tests could be the points where the attacker is checking for certain conditions. If I can skip these calls or their preceding instructions in a way that bypasses the tests, it might allow the code to continue executing.\n\nFor each call instruction and its subsequent conditional checks, I'll try to construct patterns that skip over them. This means capturing the surrounding context bytes before the call and after the test but not including the actual call itself. By doing this, I can create a pattern that represents these skipped instructions without triggering the attacker's guards.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long. I'll include enough preceding and following bytes to uniquely identify the pattern without being too specific. Also, any address or offset bytes should be replaced with wildcards (??) as per the rules.\n\nLet me go through each call step by step:\n\n1. The first call is E8431C0000 at line 00421408. This seems to follow a mov instruction. If I can skip moving into that register and then bypass this call, it might work.\n   \n2. Next, there's E8EE82FFFF at 0042140D. After that, the code calls another function (E889E0FFFF) after moving a value from another register.\n\n3. Then, we have multiple test and jump instructions before each call. For example, lines 00421417-00421422 involve testing EAX and jumping based on that.\n\nI'll create patterns by capturing the context before these calls and after any necessary tests but not including the actual call bytes. Each pattern will include the surrounding instructions to uniquely match the bypass path.\n\nNow, I'll draft each pattern:\n\nPattern 0: Skips around the first call (E8431C0000). It includes moving EBP, testing EAX, and jumping without executing the call.\nPattern 1: Targets the second call (E8EE82FFFF), skipping its preceding mov and test instructions.\nPattern 2: Focuses on the third call (E889E0FFFF) with a similar approach.\n\nEach pattern will use wildcards for any address or offset, keep opcodes concrete, and include enough surrounding context to be specific but not too long. This should help in creating effective bypass patterns that can be matched against the trace without being too broad.\n</think>\n\nHere are three distinct bypass patterns constructed based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting call instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            85 C0 ??. ??. ??. ?? \n            0F 84 ??. ??. ??. ??\n            E8 F3 FF FF F1 ?? \n            00 00\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            6A ?? ??.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from the previous attempts. Let's start by understanding what happened in the first iteration.\n\nIn the first attempt, the rule hit but didn't find any new signatures. That means whatever pattern we tried matched, but it wasn't specific enough or maybe it was matching too broadly. So, I need to be more precise this time.\n\nLooking at the trace provided, there are several calls and checks happening before the exit process. The instructions show a lot of conditional jumps, like E8431C0000 which is a call with an offset, and then some tests on EAX with JE or JNE. These seem to be part of the decision-making process that might be bypassed.\n\nThe original strategy was Strategy A: Eviction Check, targeting the first 30% of the trace with a pattern like CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE. Maybe this wasn't specific enough because it's too broad in the early calls.\n\nI should make sure my patterns are more specific to where the actual decision is made. Let me look at the trace again.\n\nLooking at the trace, I see several places where conditional jumps happen before the exit:\n\n1. E8431C0000: call 00423050h with an offset of 0x431c0000\n2. E8EE82FFFF: call 00419700h with a long offset\n3. E889E0FFFF: call 0041F4A0h\n\nThese seem to be key points where the function is making decisions. Maybe these are the points I should target for bypass.\n\nI can create patterns that capture these calls followed by specific jumps or tests. Since I need three different patterns, let's identify distinct sections:\n\n- Pattern 1: The first significant call (E8431C0000) with a specific offset and then a JE/JNE.\n- Pattern 2: Another conditional jump before the exit, like E8EE82FFFF followed by a specific instruction.\n- Pattern 3: A different call structure leading to another decision point.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is exactly 6 bytes or more but no longer than 20. I should use wildcards for address offsets to avoid false positives. Also, using specific instructions and their exact byte sequences will help in matching the correct locations.\n\nLet me draft these patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 1: E8431C0000 (call) followed by a JE or JNE on a specific instruction.\n2. Pattern 2: E8EE82FFFF (call) followed by another conditional check.\n3. Pattern 3: E889E0FFFF (call) leading to an exit decision.\n\nBy making these patterns more specific, they should hit the intended target without matching other parts of the trace, thus improving the bypass rule's effectiveness.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The initial strategy focused on a broad Eviction Check pattern, which was too generic and failed to specifically target the actual decision points. By identifying key conditional jump instructions in the trace, we create specific patterns that target these critical decision-making steps, increasing the likelihood of bypass success without false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: Targeting the specific calls followed by conditional jumps ensures the pattern matches only at intended decision points, reducing false matches and improving bypass efficiency.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with specific conditional checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 43 1C 00 00 ?? } -- Specific call with offset and conditional jump\n        $pattern1 = { E8 EE 82 FFFF ?? } -- Another conditional call leading to decision\n        $pattern2 = { E8 89 E0 FFFF ?? } -- Third conditional call before exit\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
