They mentioned needing exactly three different patterns, each between 6-20 bytes, using wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I need to extract three distinct instruction sequences. Each sequence should be converted into a Yara hex pattern with wildcards where applicable.\n\nFirst, let's identify possible instruction sequences in the trace:\n\n1. The first part has E8 followed by some operations. Maybe take E8 and include surrounding instructions.\n2. There's an 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? which could be another pattern.\n3. Another area with 6A ?? ... might form a third pattern.\n\nI'll create each pattern ensuring they're between 6-20 bytes and use wildcards for unknown or address/offset parts.\n\nLet me draft the patterns:\n\nPattern 0: E8 followed by four question marks, then 83 C4. This makes sense from the trace.\nPattern 1: 74 ?? as it's a common conditional jump.\nPattern 2: Combining multiple instructions with wildcards to cover more bytes.\n\nNow, I'll structure each pattern correctly in Yara syntax and ensure they're unique.

The current best rule didn't find any new signatures, which means it's hitting the same issue every time\u2014probably using the wrong location in the trace.\n\nLooking at the trace provided, there are several calls and checks happening before the exit. Strategy A suggests checking the first 30% of the trace for a call followed by a test on EAX with JE or JNE. That makes sense because if the previous attempt didn't work, maybe it was using the wrong instruction after the call.\n\nIn the trace, I can see calls to functions like gettickcount and other API functions. Maybe one of these calls is where the bypass should happen. For example, a pattern might be something like \"CALL followed by TEST EAX with JE/JNE\". That would target the check function before proceeding to exit.\n\nAnother strategy is Strategy B, which looks for checks before the exit call. If the first 30% didn't work, maybe the issue is that the bypass happened after some conditional logic. So checking if there's a conditional before the exit could help. For instance, looking for something like \"Testing EAX with JE/JNE before calling ExitProcess\".\n\nI also need to consider using specific patterns from the trace. Each byte in the pattern must match exactly what's in the trace data to ensure it only matches the correct location. So I'll look for unique instruction sequences that are part of the exit process.\n\nLet me list out possible patterns based on the trace:\n\n1. The first call after the start might be a test for EAX, like \"call gettickcount, test eax with je/jne\".\n2. Before the exit call, there's another check using cmp and je, which could be a bypass point.\n3. A specific instruction sequence right before the ExitProcess that can be bypassed.\n\nBy creating three distinct patterns based on these observations, each targeting different parts of the trace where decisions are made rather than just the exit itself, I should increase the chances of finding a valid bypass path without causing errors due to matching wrong locations.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's an improved YARA rule incorporating specific patterns from the provided trace:\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original attempt didn't find new signatures, likely due to using the wrong location in the trace.

Let me start by understanding what they've done so far.\n\nFirst, looking at their previous attempt, it seems they tried creating a bypass rule with three patterns but failed because of pattern length issues. The error message mentioned that each pattern was too short\u2014specifically, 5 bytes instead of the required minimum of 6. So, I need to ensure each pattern is between 6 and 20 bytes.\n\nThe user provided the trace data from their analysis, which shows a bunch of instructions. My job is to extract exactly three distinct patterns from this trace, making sure each is at least 6 bytes long. Also, all address/offset bytes should be replaced with `??` as per Yara's wildcard principle. Additionally, I have to include the `cape_options` in the meta section.\n\nLooking at their previous patterns:\n- $pattern0 was too short (5 bytes).\n- It included a call instruction and some surrounding operations.\n- The next pattern also had issues with address bytes not being replaced correctly.\n- The third pattern had similar problems, including incorrect opcode placements.\n\nI need to create three new patterns. Let me go through the trace step by step to identify suitable sequences of instructions that can form 6-byte (or longer) patterns without raw addresses or hardcoded values.\n\nStarting from the top of the trace:\n1. The first few instructions involve pushing values and calling functions, like `E8B0C8F9FF` which is probably a function call.\n2. Later on, there are more calls like `E8D1C7F9FF`.\n\nI'll try to extract patterns from these sections.\n\nFor the first pattern ($pattern0), I can take an instruction sequence that includes a call and surrounding context. Maybe something starting with E8 followed by some offset bytes since it's a function call.\n\nSecond, looking for another distinct set of instructions where there are addresses or operations that should be wildcarded. Perhaps involving push operations but ensuring the pattern is unique.\n\nThird, find another section in the trace with different instruction sequences, again making sure to include wildcards where necessary.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern has a mix of opcodes and operands, including any address or offset bytes replaced with `??`. Also, each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long. Let me draft some possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1: Maybe starting from E8B0C8F9FF but considering the next few bytes as wildcards since it's a function call.\nPattern 2: Could include a push and pop instruction sequence, using wildcards for addresses.\nPattern 3: Another distinct set of instructions with different opcodes and operands.\n\nI also need to make sure that all three patterns are unique and each is at least 6 bytes. Let me structure them accordingly, replacing address/offsets with `??` as needed.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
