do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to create a Yara rule based on the given trace and apply counterfactual analysis to find potential bypass points. Let me start by understanding what's happening in the trace.\n\nLooking at the trace, it shows a program execution that ends with an exit. The instruction at line 0x1a (which is AF6218) calls E80D0C0000, which probably leads to exiting the program. So, if I can find a way to bypass this call without changing anything else in the code, it would be useful for an evasion scenario.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible ways this call could have been made. The instruction is E8 0D 0C 00 00, which is a CALL with two zero bytes as offset. Since the offset is known (probably part of the code), it might be hard to bypass directly by changing the offset because it's hardcoded in the trace.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other instructions before this call that could have been modified. For example, if an earlier instruction was skipped or altered without affecting the flow control, the program would skip over the call and continue executing normally, thus not exiting.\n\nLooking at the trace again, let me see which instructions might be candidates for bypassing. The key is to find instructions where skipping them wouldn't lead to the exit but instead allow execution to proceed as if they never happened.\n\nOne possible approach is to look for conditional jumps or loops that could skip over the call instruction. For example, a loop condition that isn't met because of a skipped instruction would cause the code to continue executing beyond the call.\n\nAlternatively, maybe an earlier instruction was part of a subroutine or function that's called by this E8 instruction. If that subroutine is bypassed without affecting the control flow, the call would be skipped, preventing exit.\n\nAnother possibility is a conditional jump like 74 or 0F 84 that could skip over the call if certain conditions aren't met after being modified.\n\nI should also consider any other instructions before E8 that might have been altered. For instance, if an earlier instruction was a PUSH followed by POP without changing anything, it wouldn't affect the program flow and could be used to bypass something else leading up to the call.\n\nWait, in the trace, there's a call at 0x1a (E8 0D 0C 00 00). If I can find an instruction that directly precedes this call or affects its execution, skipping it might prevent the call from happening. But since the offset is zero and fixed, changing it isn't feasible without knowing the address.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a conditional jump before E8 that could skip over it if the condition changes. For example, an instruction like 74 ?? (a short jump) followed by modifying its target to avoid jumping when skipped.\n\nHmm, but in Yara rules, we can't modify the code; we can only bypass certain instructions. So maybe I need to find a conditional instruction that, when skipped, would normally cause the next instruction to be executed instead of the call.\n\nLooking at the trace again, let's see:\n\nAt line 0x14 (AF6204), there's an instruction: 8D4301. That's lea eax, dword ptr [ebx+01h]. If this were skipped or changed without affecting anything else, maybe it could prevent the call from being executed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at other lines like AF61F8 and AF61F7 where E8 instructions are called with 0x28 and 0x29 offsets. These might be part of a larger code that's conditionally skipped elsewhere in the program.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me focus on finding three distinct patterns where skipping them would prevent the exit due to bypassing the E8 call.\n\n1. Maybe an earlier instruction that directly before the E8 call can be skipped.\n2. A conditional jump after some other instructions that could skip over the call if modified.\n3. Another instruction further back in the code that, when skipped or altered, doesn't affect the flow but skips a part leading up to the call.\n\nI think I need to identify three specific sequences where bypassing them would prevent the program from executing E8 0D 0C 00 00 and thus not exit. Each pattern should be around 6-20 bytes, combining multiple instructions as needed with wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nLet me draft some possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1: The instruction before E8 is a conditional jump or something that can skip over it.\nPattern 2: A series of instructions after the call but before the exit point that can be bypassed without affecting control flow.\nPattern 3: An earlier instruction that, when skipped, leads to an alternative execution path.\n\nWait, considering the structure of the trace, maybe there's a conditional jump near E8. For example, if the target of a short jump is modified so it doesn't skip over the call.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the call is part of a loop that can be bypassed by skipping one iteration or modifying the condition.\n\nI think I need to pick three distinct sequences where each could potentially prevent the call from executing, thus keeping the program running without exiting.\n\nAfter some thought, here's what I'll do:\n\n1. Pattern 0: The conditional jump before E8 instruction (like 74 ??), when skipped, would execute the next instruction instead of skipping.\n2. Pattern 1: A series of instructions after a call that can be bypassed to skip further into the code without affecting the flow leading to the exit.\n3. Pattern 2: An earlier instruction like a PUSH followed by POP but with different operands so it doesn't affect anything, thus allowing execution past the call.\n\nEach pattern will need to include enough context and wildcards where necessary, ensuring that address/offset bytes are replaced with ?? while keeping opcode and register encoding concrete.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is unique and covers a distinct part of the trace. Then, I'll construct the Yara rule accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo create a Yara bypass rule based on the given trace, we need to identify three potential instruction sequences that could be skipped or modified without affecting the program flow beyond bypassing specific parts leading up to the call instruction at E8 0D 0C 00 00. Each pattern must cover 6-20 bytes and include wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting the exit call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 74 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
