      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this Yara rule because there were some validation errors. The user provided a lot of information, including the invalid hex pattern and the previous (invalid) rule they tried. My task is to analyze these issues and generate a corrected Yara rule.\n\nFirst, looking at the error analysis: the main issue was an invalid hex pattern with characters that aren't valid in hexadecimal or some incorrect encoding between bytes. The strings were defined incorrectly, like having [0x456789AB][0xDEF00ABC], which uses both 4 and 5 as prefixes for hex numbers? Wait, no, actually, it's just two separate hex bytes. But Yara requires each byte to be a valid hex value without any additional characters.\n\nAlso, the previous rule had syntax errors: missing braces { }, incorrect hex format with spaces between bytes, and string assignments in the wrong format. So I need to fix that by ensuring proper syntax—each string starts with $pattern followed by = and then the hex bytes separated by commas or curly braces.\n\nThe original trace data shows a series of instructions with their opcodes and operands. The corrected rule should include patterns from these instructions, each exactly 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards (??) for any address/offset bytes. Also, each pattern must be unique; so I need to pick three different instruction sequences.\n\nLooking at the example provided in the reasoning strategy, they combined multiple consecutive instructions into a single pattern with wildcards where needed. So I should do something similar here.\n\nLet me go through the trace step by step and identify potential bypass points:\n\n1. The first few instructions are `85 C0`, which is TEST EAX, then `0F 84` (JE 00D46190h), followed by another call. This could be a candidate.\n2. Then there's a `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` as part of the call instruction and some memory access with ??.\n3. Another part has `6A ?? 5A ...`, which might form a second pattern.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is exactly between 6-20 bytes, includes opcode bytes concretely, and replaces any address/offset with ??.\n\nSo for $pattern0, perhaps combine TEST EAX (85 C0), the JE instruction (0F 84), and part of the next call. Let me count: 85, C0, 0F, 84 would be four bytes. To make it longer, I can include some following instructions.\n\nWait, but each pattern is a sequence of bytes from consecutive instructions. So perhaps:\n\n- Pattern1 could be `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`, which is the call instruction plus its offset.\n- Pattern2 might combine the 6A (PUSH), ?? (register encoding), and so on.\n\nBut I need to make sure that each pattern includes enough context to avoid false positives. Also, since the trace has many instructions, it's better to pick patterns that are specific but still long enough to be meaningful.\n\nAnother approach: look for sequences where a known bypass instruction occurs followed by a conditional jump or similar. Maybe combining TEST EAX with JE and then a call could form a pattern.\n\nBut I think it's safer to take three different instruction sequences from the trace, each forming a unique 6-20 byte pattern with wildcards as needed.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. Pattern1: TEST EAX (85 C0), followed by JE (0F 84), then a call (E8 ?? ?? ??). So that's 7 bytes.\n2. Pattern2: Another sequence, perhaps from the PUSH instruction (6A) and some subsequent operations. Maybe include more bytes around it with wildcards.\n3. Pattern3: A different set of instructions elsewhere in the trace.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each pattern is unique. So maybe:\n\n- Pattern1: TEST EAX, JE, call\n- Pattern2: Another instruction like 8B 45 (MOV), followed by some context with wildcards.\n- Pattern3: Maybe a different combination from another part of the trace.\n\nI think I have enough information to draft three patterns now. Each should be between 6 and 20 bytes, include opcodes concretely, and address/offsets replaced with ??.\n\nNow, putting it all together in Yara format.\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected Yara rule based on the analysis and requirements:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? E8 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 74 8A ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **$pattern0**: Combines TEST EAX (85 C0), JE (0F 84), and a call instruction with wildcards for the offset bytes.\n2. **$pattern1**: Includes PUSH, stack displacement, and context with wildcards to avoid false matches.\n3. **$pattern2**: Matches a conditional jump (74/75) followed by memory access instructions.\n\nEach pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards for address/offsets, includes concrete opcode bytes, and ensures uniqueness across the three patterns.",

Let me pick three different instruction sequences that could potentially be used by an evader.\n\nFor the first pattern, maybe combine a TEST EAX with some jumps and pushes.
