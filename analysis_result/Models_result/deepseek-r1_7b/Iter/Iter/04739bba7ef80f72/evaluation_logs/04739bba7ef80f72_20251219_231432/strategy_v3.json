(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this malware trace that's exiting early because of sandbox evasion. The goal is to figure out how the attacker might have bypassed some checks and then create patterns for defenders to detect.\n\nLooking at the trace data, there are several call instructions like E8431C0000, E8EE82FFFF, etc., which probably lead into other parts of the program. I notice that after each call, there's a test on EAX (like 85C0). The attacker might be trying to avoid these tests by manipulating the flow.\n\nFirst, I think about where in the code these checks are placed. Each time there's an EAX test followed by a jump or continuation. So maybe the attacker is inserting bypass instructions before those checks get triggered.\n\nPhase 1: From the attacker's perspective, they would want to implement evasion techniques like call logging and EAX checks. Their evasion logic might involve pushing values onto the stack (like 00421420 push 0) or modifying the EAX register.\n\nLooking at Phase 2 for the defender, the bypass points could be where these EAX tests are followed by a jump that continues execution instead of exiting. The idea is to skip those test and jump instructions so the program continues without triggering the exit.\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n1. Skipping the push instruction before the EAX test would prevent the test from being executed.\n2. Skipping the EAX test itself (like 85C0) would allow execution to proceed beyond that check.\n3. Skipping the jump after the EAX test would continue execution instead of exiting.\n\nEach of these points has a reason why skipping them would bypass the evasion checks. For example, if we skip the push instruction before the EAX test, it might prevent the test from being triggered because the stack isn't manipulated as expected.\n\nNow, for building patterns:\n- Pattern 1 could be around the call to 00423050h followed by a test on EAX and then skipping some instructions.\n- Pattern 2 might involve pushing 0 before an EAX test and then bypassing it.\n- Pattern 3 could target the jump after the EAX test.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards where necessary for addresses or offsets, and keeps opcodes and registers concrete. Also, each pattern should be unique and cover different parts of the trace to catch various evasion methods.\n</think>\n\nHere's a structured analysis based on the provided data:\n\n### Phase 1: Attacker's Evasion Strategy\n\nThe attacker likely implemented the following checks:\n- **Check 1:** `E8431C0000` (call) - To verify program flow.\n- **Check 2:** `85C0` (test EAX) - To ensure specific instructions are executed.\n- **Check 3:** `740E` (je) - To redirect execution based on conditions.\n\nThe evasion logic bypasses these checks to continue execution.\n\n### Phase 2: Defender's Bypass Analysis\n\nPotential bypass points and their effects:\n1. **Skipping `85C0`:** Neutralizes the EAX test, allowing continued execution.\n2. **Skipping `740E`:** Fails the jump check, exiting early.\n3. **Skipping a Push Instruction:** Prevents stack manipulation before an EAX test.\n\n### Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis\n\n- The bypass is specific to EAX tests but may not affect other similar checks.\n- It could be detected with immediate context analysis or advanced logging tools.\n- Varying the pushed values (like using different constants) can make it harder for detectors to identify.\n\n### Phase 4: Bypass Patterns\n\n**Pattern 0:** Skips a push instruction before an EAX test, neutralizing the check.  \n**Pattern 1:** Skips the `85C0` EAX test.  \n**Pattern 2:** Skips a jump after the EAX test.\n\n### Phase 5: Pattern Construction\n\nEach pattern is crafted from consecutive instructions, using wildcards for address/offsets and keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 740E }  # Skip EAX test\n        $pattern1 = { 6A00 8B45 }   # Skip push instruction before EAX test\n        $pattern2 = { FF151428 4300 }  # Skip jump after EAX test\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
