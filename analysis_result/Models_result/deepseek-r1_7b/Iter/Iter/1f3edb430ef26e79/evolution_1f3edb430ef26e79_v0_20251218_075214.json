The task is to create exactly three different 6-20 byte patterns targeting suspicious evasion points.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the instruction list provided. Evasion typically occurs when a program tries to avoid detection by bypassing certain checks, like memory protection or stack manipulation.\n\nI notice several call and ret instructions with specific parameters. For example, there's a call to RtlAllocateHeap@NTDLL.DLL and then a ret at offset 0x3 (C3). This seems suspicious because allocating heap resources can be an evasion technique.\n\nAnother point is the call to RtlFreeHeap@NTDLL.DLL, which might be used after freeing memory to bypass some checks. Also, there are multiple calls to various addresses with similar structures, like 0041EB47h and others. These could indicate attempts to manipulate registers or stack for bypass.\n\nLooking further, I see a lot of push and pop operations on ebp, esp, and other registers. For instance, pushing esi, then eax, etc., followed by calls and rets. This suggests that the code is trying different ways to simulate stack behavior, which could be an evasion method.\n\nThere's also a long sequence starting at 0041E24F with call eax@ExitProcess@KERNEL32.DLL (Import, Hidden, Unknown Params). This might indicate an attempt to exit the process without going through the usual legitimate exit methods, possibly evading detection.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple calls to functions like mov and add operations that manipulate registers. These could be part of bypass attempts, such as simulating certain behaviors or preparing for stack manipulation.\n\nI should focus on extracting sequences from these instructions where there's a clear attempt to bypass security checks. For example, the call to RtlAllocateHeap followed by ret might indicate a heap allocation bypass. Another could involve pushing and popping values in a way that suggests resource management bypass.\n\nLet me try to form three distinct patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern includes the call to RtlAllocateHeap and then some pushes and pops around it.\n2. The second pattern involves multiple push/pop operations followed by a call to another address.\n3. The third pattern might be a longer sequence involving several mov and add instructions before a call.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards for addresses, and keeps opcodes and register encodings concrete. Each pattern must be unique to avoid overlap with others.\n\nAfter careful examination, I can extract the following patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern starts at the call to RtlAllocateHeap and includes nearby push/pop and ret instructions.\n2. The second pattern involves a series of pushes on ebp and related registers followed by a call to an address.\n3. The third pattern is a longer sequence with several movs, adds, and a final call.\n\nEach will be converted into YARA patterns using the wildcard principle where necessary, ensuring they are specific enough but not too precise that they don't match the intended locations.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 56 5E 8B4514 EC 55 39 4F 5A 8B4514 EC 55 39 4F }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B452C 50 8BEC 5D 8B4528 50 8BEC 5D 8B4534 50 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B5514 EC 5A 5E 6A 5D 8B450C 50 8BEC 5D 8B450C 50 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
