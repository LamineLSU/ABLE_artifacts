        "prompt_tokens": 3155,
        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this Yara trace and asked to create a bypass rule based on it. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace provided, there are a bunch of instructions. It seems like it's dealing with some kind of bypass or evasion because the program exits unexpectedly. My task is to find patterns where certain instructions can be skipped without causing an exit.\n\nPhase 1: Establish the factual outcome. The program exits after executing these instructions, so I need to see what leads directly to the exit. Looking at the trace, it ends with a CALL instruction and then TEST EAX, which might lead to an exit if not bypassed.\n\nPhase 2: For each suspicious instruction, consider skipping them. Let's pick out some key points:\n\n- The program calls a function (E8 ??.?? ?? ??) and then after some steps, it does TEST EAX.\n- So maybe the call is to TEST EAX or something similar that would cause an exit if not bypassed.\n\nPhase 3: Generate counterfactual hypotheses. Let's think about which instructions could be skipped:\n\n1. The first instruction in the trace is a JE (Jump on Error) or perhaps another conditional jump. If we skip this, does the program continue? Maybe.\n2. The test after the call might be TEST EAX. Skipping this would allow execution to proceed without exiting.\n\nPhase 4: Evaluate each hypothesis. For example, skipping the JE instruction at line X might not prevent an exit if there's another path. But skipping the TEST instruction could lead the program to continue.\n\nPhase 5: Build patterns. I need exactly three different 6-20 byte patterns based on these hypotheses.\n\nLet me try to extract the relevant parts of the trace:\n\n1. The JE or conditional jump might be at line X, but looking closer, it's actually a series of TEST and other instructions that might bypass. Maybe around the E8 call instruction.\n\nWait, in the trace, after several steps, there's a CALL E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is followed by TEST EAX 0F 84 ?? ?? ??. So perhaps skipping the TEST would prevent an exit.\n\nSimilarly, before that, maybe a conditional jump (like 75) or another JE could be bypassed. Also, looking for other jumps like JZ or JMP that can be skipped.\n\nWait, let me look at specific parts:\n\nLooking at instruction lines where there's a call and then TEST EAX. If we skip the TEST, execution continues. So maybe pattern1 is around that area.\n\nAnother possible spot is around the initial JE or conditional jump (75) which could be bypassed to allow execution to proceed.\n\nAnd perhaps another instruction further down that can be skipped, like a conditional jump elsewhere.\n\nBut I need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards where necessary. Also, all patterns must come from the trace data.\n\nLet me try to extract three different bypass points:\n\n1. Skipping the TEST EAX after the call: So looking at the call instruction (E8 ??) followed by TEST EAX ?? ????. The pattern would include E8, then some bytes before and after.\n\nWait, in the provided code snippet, around line 75, it's a JE or similar. Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\nLine 1: 6A C0 F3 ... (PUSH ...)\n...\nLine 24-29: There's a TEST EAX instruction.\n\nSo perhaps before that TEST EAX is another instruction like a conditional jump which can be bypassed to prevent the exit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple calls followed by TEST EAX. So I can create patterns around those areas.\n\nWait, let me look at the code snippet:\n\nAt line 24: TEST EAX 0F 84 ?? ?? ??\n\nSo after that, it's a loop or something else. If we skip this TEST instruction, execution would proceed past it.\n\nBut wait, in the given trace, after TEST EAX, there are more instructions like 85 C0 0F 84 ?? and so on. So perhaps if the TEST is skipped, those subsequent bytes wouldn't be executed, allowing bypass.\n\nSo let's consider creating a pattern that includes the TEST instruction and surrounding context to replace address/offsets with wildcards.\n\nSimilarly, before that TEST, there might be other jumps or JE instructions that can be bypassed.\n\nAnother possible spot is around the initial E8 call. Maybe it's called from somewhere else, but if we skip the TEST after it, execution continues.\n\nAlternatively, looking at lines 25-30: There are multiple calls to functions like E5 ?? and so on, which might have conditions that can be bypassed.\n\nBut I need exactly three patterns, each 6-20 bytes, different from each other.\n\nLet me try to outline them:\n\n1. Pattern around the initial JE or conditional jump (maybe line X) that can be skipped.\n2. Pattern right before the TEST EAX instruction, which can be skipped if it's a conditional jump.\n3. Another spot further down with a call and its associated offset that can be bypassed.\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern uses wildcards correctly.\n\nLet me pick specific instructions:\n\nPattern 1: Surrounding the initial JE or 75/74 instruction.\n\nLooking at line numbers, perhaps lines 6-10 contain a conditional jump. Let's say it's at E8 ?? with some offset.\n\nWait, in the trace, after several instructions starting from 2A:\n\nLine 2A: 6A C0 F3 ... (PUSH)\n...\nLine 75: Maybe something else?\n\nAlternatively, looking for specific jumps like 74 or 75. Let's assume there's a 75 0C instruction around line X.\n\nSo if we replace the offset with ??, it would be 75 ??.\n\nPattern1 could be:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? TEST EAX ??\n\nBut need to include surrounding context to make it specific.\n\nSimilarly, another pattern before the TEST EAX at line Y.\n\nWait, let's think about TEST instruction: 0F 84. So in the trace, after the call, we have TEST EAX 0F 84 ??.\n\nIf I can skip this TEST instruction, execution would proceed to the next instruction (the loop or something else). But since TEST is part of the condition that causes exit, skipping it might allow the program to continue.\n\nSo Pattern1 could be: E8 ??.?? ?? ?? ?? TEST ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nWait, maybe more precisely:\n\nE8 75 0C (offset) TEST EAX 0F 84 ?? ?? ??\n\nBut need to include wildcards. So perhaps E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? TEST ?? ?? ??\n\nSimilarly, another pattern elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the initial JE or conditional jump before any function calls.\n\nSuppose at line Z, there's a 75 0C instruction which can be bypassed with a skip. Then Pattern2 would be: 75 ?? ...\n\nAnd another call further down that can be skipped.\n\nPutting it all together, I think three patterns could be:\n\n1. Skipping the TEST EAX after the initial function call.\n   - So around lines where TEST is at offset ??, making sure to include enough surrounding instructions for specificity.\n\n2. Bypassing a conditional jump (like 75) before the function calls.\n   - Replacing the instruction and its offset with wildcards.\n\n3. Skipping another instruction after a series of pushes or other operations.\n\nEach pattern must be unique and cover specific sequences, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nI'll need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long and that they're distinct from each other.\n</think>\n\nTo create the YARA rule based on the given trace, we analyze the instructions for possible bypass points. The key steps involve identifying where the program exits, hypothesizing which instructions can be skipped without causing an exit, evaluating these hypotheses, and then constructing patterns with wildcards.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identifying Exit Path**: The program exits after a series of function calls leading to a TEST EAX instruction.\n2. **Hypothesizing Bypass Points**:\n   - Skipping the TEST EAX after the initial function call allows execution to continue.\n   - A conditional jump (e.g., 75) before the function calls can be bypassed.\n   - Another call with its associated offset can be skipped further down.\n\n### Patterns:\n1. **Pattern 1**: Skips the TEST instruction, preventing exit.\n2. **Pattern 2**: Bypasses a conditional jump without causing an exit.\n3. **Pattern 3**: Skips another call to bypass evasion.\n\nEach pattern is constructed to be specific (6-20 bytes) and uses wildcards for address/offsets as required.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??
