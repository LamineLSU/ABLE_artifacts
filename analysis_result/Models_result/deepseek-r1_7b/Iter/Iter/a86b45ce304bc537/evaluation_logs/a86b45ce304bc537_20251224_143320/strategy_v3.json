(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a Yara rule based on the given trace and then correct it according to the provided strategy and examples. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data. It seems to be from two different traces: one labeled Phase 1 and another with some patterns marked as exits. The code has a lot of calls (E8 instructions) followed by FFD0 which is probably a syscall for exit, but sometimes it just continues executing.\n\nThe user wants me to think like an attacker first to figure out what checks the malware implemented and then how a defender can bypass them. From the Phase 1 analysis, I need to identify where the evasion checks are in the trace. Then in Phase 2, find potential points where the defender can manipulate instructions to bypass these checks.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- There's an E8 instruction followed by 4 bytes (probably a displacement or offset).\n- Another call is made with E8 again.\n- After that, there are patterns like FFD0 which might be exit calls but sometimes continue execution.\n\nI think the attacker implemented some checks before calling FFD0. Maybe they have conditions to ensure certain instructions are executed after an E8 call.\n\nIn Phase 2, for the defender, I need to find where in the code execution can be bypassed or manipulated. If the defender skips specific instructions, it might cause the checks to fail and execution to continue.\n\nNow, according to the strategy:\n\n1. As attacker: What am I trying to detect? Maybe FDD0 (syscall 2) as exit but only after certain conditions.\n   - Check for E8 with a specific offset or something else that triggers the call to FFD0.\n   \n2. As defender: Where can they manipulate instructions?\n   - If there's an instruction before E8, maybe a test or conditional jump that can be bypassed.\n\nFrom the trace, I see calls after multiple pushes and pops. Perhaps the attacker checks if certain registers are set (like EAX) before calling FFD0.\n\nSo, in Phase 2, to bypass, the defender could skip some instructions like TEST EAX or JZ something before the E8 call, making it so the check passes but execution continues.\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n\n- Target 1: Skipping a TEST instruction might allow execution to continue after an E8 without the check failing.\n- Target 2: Skipping a conditional jump (like JG or JL) could let the code proceed past the check.\n- Target 3: Maybe skipping a memory access instruction that would otherwise trigger another check.\n\nNow, creating patterns based on these points. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for address/offsets and concrete opcodes.\n\nI need to extract three different patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Maybe skips a TEST EAX before an E8 call.\n   - Example: 85 C0 (TEST EAX), 0F, then some other instructions leading up to E8 with wildcards for offsets.\n\n2. Pattern 1: Skips a conditional jump after pushing and popping registers, allowing execution past it.\n   - Like skipping push ebp or pop ebp.\n\n3. Pattern 2: Skips a memory access instruction that would trigger another check before FFD0.\n\nEach pattern needs to be combined with adjacent instructions, using wildcards where appropriate.\n\nNow, putting this into Yara patterns:\n\nFor each pattern, wrap the hex bytes in { } and include the target instruction plus surrounding context. Use ?? for any address or offset.\n\nSo Pattern 0 might involve TEST EAX, then some other registers, leading to an E8 with a wildcarded displacement.\n\nPattern 1 could be around pushing and popping ebp without checking conditions that would trigger jumps.\n\nPattern 2 might be skipping over a conditional move instruction before the exit call.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes. Also, include the correct opcode and register encodings without any hardcoded addresses.\n\nFinally, adding the cape_options with bp0, bp1, etc., referencing each pattern.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Evasion_Bypass_Patterns\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 45 ?? ?? ?? ??
