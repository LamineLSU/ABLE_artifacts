(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a Yara rule based on the given trace and then correct it according to the provided strategy and examples. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data. It seems to be from two different traces: one labeled Phase 1 and another with some patterns marked as exits. The code has a lot of calls (E8 instructions) followed by FFD0 which is probably a syscall for exit, but sometimes it just continues executing.\n\nThe user wants me to think like an attacker first to figure out what checks the malware implemented and then how a defender can bypass them. From the Phase 1 analysis, I need to identify where the evasion checks are in the trace. Then in Phase 2, find potential points where the defender can manipulate instructions to bypass these checks.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- There's an E8 instruction followed by 4 bytes (probably a displacement or offset).\n- Another call is made with E8 again.\n- After that, there are patterns like FFD0 which might be exit calls but sometimes continue execution.\n\nI think the attacker implemented some checks before calling FFD0. Maybe they have conditions to ensure certain instructions are executed after an E8 call.\n\nIn Phase 2, for the defender, I need to find where in the code execution can be bypassed or manipulated. If the defender skips specific instructions, it might cause the checks to fail and execution to continue.\n\nNow, according to the strategy:\n\n1. As attacker: What am I trying to detect? Maybe FDD0 (syscall 2) as exit but only after certain conditions.\n   - Check for E8 with a specific offset or something else that triggers the call to FFD0.\n   \n2. As defender: Where can they manipulate instructions?\n   - If there's an instruction before E8, maybe a test or conditional jump that can be bypassed.\n\nFrom the trace, I see calls after multiple pushes and pops. Perhaps the attacker checks if certain registers are set (like EAX) before calling FFD0.\n\nSo, in Phase 2, to bypass, the defender could skip some instructions like TEST EAX or JZ something before the E8 call, making it so the check passes but execution continues.\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n\n- Target 1: Skipping a TEST instruction might allow execution to continue after an E8 without the check failing.\n- Target 2: Skipping a conditional jump (like JG or JL) could let the code proceed past the check.\n- Target 3: Maybe skipping a memory access instruction that would otherwise trigger another check.\n\nNow, creating patterns based on these points. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for address/offsets and concrete opcodes.\n\nI need to extract three different patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Maybe skips a TEST EAX before an E8 call.\n   - Example: 85 C0 (TEST EAX), 0F, then some other instructions leading up to E8 with wildcards for offsets.\n\n2. Pattern 1: Skips a conditional jump after pushing and popping registers, allowing execution past it.\n   - Like skipping push ebp or pop ebp.\n\n3. Pattern 2: Skips a memory access instruction that would trigger another check before FFD0.\n\nEach pattern needs to be combined with adjacent instructions, using wildcards where appropriate.\n\nNow, putting this into Yara patterns:\n\nFor each pattern, wrap the hex bytes in { } and include the target instruction plus surrounding context. Use ?? for any address or offset.\n\nSo Pattern 0 might involve TEST EAX, then some other registers, leading to an E8 with a wildcarded displacement.\n\nPattern 1 could be around pushing and popping ebp without checking conditions that would trigger jumps.\n\nPattern 2 might be skipping over a conditional move instruction before the exit call.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes. Also, include the correct opcode and register encodings without any hardcoded addresses.\n\nFinally, adding the cape_options with bp0, bp1, etc., referencing each pattern.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Evasion_Bypass_Patterns\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 45 ?? ?? ?? ??

2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses**\nFor each suspicious instruction, ask:\n- \"What if this instruction were skipped?\"\n- \"Would the program continue instead of exiting?\"\n\n**Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis**\nFor each candidate instruction:\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* [Instruction at line X]\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit?\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit?\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* [Different instruction at line Y]\n- Same analysis...\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* [Another instruction at line Z]\n- Same analysis...\n\n**Phase 4: Select the 3 best bypass points**\nChoose instructions where skipping is likely SUFFICIENT to bypass evasion.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",
      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a Yara rule for this malware. From the trace data provided, it looks like the program is exiting with some specific instructions called out. The user wants me to find three different bypass patterns that could be used to exit the program without being detected.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the trace and see which instructions are critical for causing the exit. In both traces, there's a call to a function at line 0x1c358 (which is 6BA5558BEC8B45) that seems to be imul esp with some dword from ebp-741374ABh and 0x45. That instruction stands out because it's probably the main command that triggers the exit.\n\nI should also look for other suspicious instructions around this point. For example, before the call, there are some OR operations at 0x9c (0x8B88140A0000) and an add at 0x9e (0x6BA5558BEC8B45). These might be dependencies that need to be bypassed as well.\n\nSo, I'll consider three different approaches:\n\n1. **Bypassing the imul instruction directly:** If this line is skipped, the program might continue without exiting.\n2. **Bypassing the OR operation before imul:** If we skip these lines, maybe the imul doesn't execute correctly and exits anyway.\n3. **Bypassing another nearby instruction like add at 0x9e:** Maybe that's an alternative critical path.\n\nEach of these would need to be translated into Yara patterns with wildcards where necessary and concrete instructions otherwise.\n\nI have to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long, includes the target instruction plus some surrounding context, and uses wildcards for address/offsets. Also, all opcode bytes should remain concrete.\n\nFor example, a possible first pattern could be around the imul instruction with surrounding lines, replacing any unknown addresses or offsets with ??.\n\nI need to check that each of these three patterns is unique and covers different parts of the code to avoid false positives.\n</think>\n\nHere's a Yara rule based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass using imul, OR, or add instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            4F 01 DE 1C CE A3 D6 DB BE 45 ?? \n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to generate a YARA bypass rule using the provided trace data. The goal is to create three different patterns that target suspicious evasion points.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the trace to find suitable instructions and their context. Evasion usually involves manipulating the flow of control or data in a way that bypasses detection mechanisms.\n\nI notice multiple `call` instructions (E8 ...) around the code. Each call is followed by four address bytes as an offset. Since these offsets are hardcoded, they can be replaced with wildcards to create a pattern.\n\nNext, there's a series of memory accesses and jumps. For example, addresses like 0x45 appear in `8B 45 ...` which could be part of a bypass pattern if the value is manipulated.\n\nI'll also look for sequences where registers are loaded or stored, like `85 C0 0F 84`, which might indicate a branch target. Combining this with surrounding instructions can form another pattern.\n\nNow, I need to create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. **Pattern 0**: Focus on the `call` instruction and its offset bytes.\n2. **Pattern 1**: Use memory access addresses that are variable.\n3. **Pattern 2**: Combine multiple instructions around a conditional jump or memory operation.\n\nEach pattern must be between 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for any address/offset bytes and keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the YARA rule with the correct format, ensuring each pattern is unique and meets the length requirements.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Evasion_Bypass_Patterns\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??

The task mentions using exactly 3 patterns, each 6-20 bytes long, with wildcards where necessary.\n\nLooking at the trace, I notice several call (E8) and jmp (75/74) instructions. These are common points for bypassing. \n\nFor the first pattern, let's consider the E8 instruction followed by four unknown or wildcard bytes. So something like `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` would be a valid 6-byte pattern.\n\nNext, I'll look for conditional jmp near (0F 84) which is often used in evasions. This can form another pattern: `0F 84 ?? ?? ??`.\n\nFinally, the third pattern could involve memory access with displacement, like an mov instruction followed by a wildcard stack offset and a constant byte. So something like `8B 45 ??` but then adding more bytes to make it longer.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and fits within the 6-20 byte requirement. Also, I must replace all address or offset bytes with `??` as per the wildcard rules.\n\nNow, formatting each pattern correctly with spaces between hex bytes and wrapping them in braces. Then, adding the cape_options reference with the patterns' offsets plus 'skip' actions for each.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting call/jump instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 75 0C ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 45 ?? ??\n```",

do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a Yara rule for this malware sample. The user provided the trace of an execute process and some instructions. My goal is to find three different bypass paths that could be used here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the trace data to see what's happening. It seems like there are multiple calls to E9 (probably a placeholder) and then a function call at 0x4F which decodes something. Then, there's an imul instruction with some offsets. The exit happens via a call to 0x5D.\n\nI need to identify the suspicious instructions. That includes conditional jumps like JE, JNZ, and so on. Also, any TEST or CMP instructions because they check conditions before jumping. Function calls like CALL, EAX, etc., could be bypassed by using different instructions.\n\nLooking at the trace, I see a lot of push and pop operations around 0x5C to 0x61 in the code. These are likely pushing and popping registers which control the call stack. There's also some OR and AND operations with CL, which might be setting flags for conditional jumps.\n\nNow, thinking about the exit path: it goes through several pushes and pops, then a jump at FFD0 to call eax again, leading to another set of instructions before exiting.\n\nTo create bypass rules, I need to think of possible ways these could be bypassed. Maybe some conditional jumps are being used, like JZ or JE after certain operations that evaluate to zero. For example, if there's a TEST EAX and then JZ, someone might push 0 onto the stack so that the condition isn't met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using pop instructions instead of push to bypass. Or perhaps some OR operations are being used before conditional jumps to set flags for specific jumps.\n\nI should consider different approaches: bypassing the function call at E9 with a different instruction like FADD or something else. Also, bypassing the imul instruction might involve pushing different values onto the stack instead of using 0x45 as an offset.\n\nAnother possibility is manipulating the stack before or after certain operations to create the right context for jumps.\n\nEach pattern needs to be constructed from consecutive instructions in the trace, converted into hex bytes, and then replaced with wildcards where necessary.

One possible bypass involves using a conditional jump after manipulating some registers.\n2. Another might involve pushing different values on the stack before or after certain operations.\n3.

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a better Yara bypass rule based on the given trace and previous failures. The task is about evading detection by bypassing certain parts of the code that detect malware.\n\nFirst, looking at the current best rule didn't work because it matched but didn't hit any new signatures. That means whatever pattern I'm trying to match isn't effective in the right place or with the correct timing. \n\nThe trace provided is pretty detailed, so I should focus on extracting useful patterns from it. The trace shows a lot of mov and push instructions, as well as some conditional jumps like E8440900 which calls another function at 0041A950h. There are also some OR operations and imul (integer multiply) that could be interesting.\n\nI remember the strategies mentioned: EVASION CHECK, EXIT DECISION, and EVASION TECHNIQUE. Since the previous attempts didn't work, maybe I should try a combination of these but with more specific patterns.\n\nFor Strategy A, which is the Evasion Check, it looks for a call followed by a test in the first 30% of the trace. But since the rule failed, perhaps that area isn't where the bypass point is. Maybe I need to look later in the trace or after some conditional checks.\n\nLooking at the trace data, there are several points where specific instructions might be used for bypassing. For example, the E8440900 call stands out because it's a function that could decide whether to proceed or exit. If I can find an instruction before this that triggers a bypass, that could work.\n\nAnother area is the OR and imul operations. These are more complex instructions that might be used for timing attacks or other evasive tactics. Maybe capturing these patterns with specific bytes could help bypass detection.\n\nI also notice some push instructions followed by calls to 0041A950h, which seems like a decision point. If I can create a pattern that matches the instruction right before this call, perhaps it would work better as a bypass point.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I need three distinct patterns:\n\n1. The first could be a conditional jump or a specific instruction sequence leading up to an exit check.\n2. The second might involve OR and imul instructions with concrete values from the trace.\n3. The third could target the push followed by a call at 0041A950h.\n\nEach pattern needs to match exactly, using wildcards for varying offsets but specific hex bytes where possible to avoid false positives. Also, ensuring that each pattern is in a different part of the trace to cover different scenarios.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts focused on early bypass points and unconditional calls, which might not be effective if evasion mechanisms are present later or conditionally. By focusing on more specific instruction sequences after initial setup code but before exit checks, we can target areas where detection is less likely.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK, VM_DETECT, TIMING_CHECK\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns look for specific operations that could indicate monitoring and are less likely to trigger evasion techniques used in the sample.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - api_check, vm_detect, timing_check\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 56 8B EC 5E 49 A3 }   # Conditional jump or exit check\n        $pattern1 = { ??

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a YARA rule for bypassing an evasion in this x86-64 process. From what I understand, evasions are sequences of instructions that can be jumped over or bypassed to avoid detection. The goal here is to find patterns that could lead the execution past these eviations.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided trace data, I need to identify any suspicious instructions. The trace seems to have multiple calls and some conditional jumps. For example, there are a lot of \"CALL\" instructions followed by some displacement bytes like FFD0. Also, there's an E8 instruction which is a call opcode.\n\nNow, thinking about the chain-of-thought strategy: I need to start by identifying all possible bypass candidates. These would likely be any calls or jumps that could skip over parts of the code. Then, tracing backwards from where the exit happens (the FFD0 call) to see what condition caused it to jump there.\n\nLooking at the trace, after the exit point, before the FFD0 call, I see some TEST and CMP instructions which might be checking certain registers or values. Maybe if those conditions are met, they cause a conditional jump that skips over some code.\n\nNext, selecting three different bypass candidates. They should be completely different instruction sequences so that each pattern is unique. Each pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long, combining the target instruction and surrounding context instructions.\n\nFor creating patterns, I'll combine consecutive instructions from the trace, making sure to include any relevant context like stack pushes or pops, or conditional jumps. Applying wildcards where applicable for address/offset bytes.\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern replaces all address/offset bytes with ?? as per the wildcard rules. Also, keep opcode and register encodings concrete. So, I can't have any raw addresses; everything related to addresses should be replaced.\n\nAfter creating these patterns, I'll structure them in YARA format, making sure each is a separate hex sequence. The meta description should explain what the rule does, and the cape_options need to reference each pattern with their respective offsets so that the bypass can work correctly.\n\nI also have to make sure there are exactly three patterns and that each is 6-20 bytes long. No duplicates allowed between the patterns. And all wildcards are properly applied.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll draft the YARA rule with these considerations in mind.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 4F ?? ?F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83C4 ?? 85C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
