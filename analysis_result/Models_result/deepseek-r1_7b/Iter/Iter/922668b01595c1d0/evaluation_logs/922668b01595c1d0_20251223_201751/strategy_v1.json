Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n",

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help create a YARA rule to bypass malware based on the given trace data and previous attempts. The goal is to improve upon the last failed attempt by identifying patterns that could be used for an evasion bypass.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces, there are three different execution points where ExitProcess is called. Each of these has similar instruction sequences but with slight variations. My task is to extract specific patterns from these traces that can be used to bypass the security checks.\n\nThe user mentioned three strategies: Evasion Check (60% success), Exit Decision (25%), and Evasion Technique (15%). Since previous attempts didn't yield any new signatures, I need to focus on finding more specific or different patterns than what was tried before.\n\nLooking at the first trace, there's a call sequence leading to a test of EAX with a JNE condition. The second trace also has similar steps but slightly different instruction ordering. The third trace is identical to the first, so maybe I can find something else in it.\n\nI notice that all traces involve calling a function (like DF02h), testing EAX, and then either jumping or proceeding based on the result. Maybe instead of looking at the entire call sequence, focusing on specific parts could help. For example, the part after the test and before the jump might be a good target.\n\nAnother idea is to look for unique instruction sequences that are not present in other traces but still relate to the exit decision. Perhaps checking if there's conditional logic before exiting could provide a bypass point.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern I create uses exact hex values from the trace, as per the critical requirements. This way, the patterns will match only where they're supposed to, reducing false positives and crashes.\n\nSince previous attempts used certain strategies, maybe trying something different like checking for specific stack operations or unique CPU instructions could help bypass the evasion checks more effectively.\n\nI should compile three distinct 6-10 byte patterns from these traces, using wildcards for varying addresses but concrete values where possible. Then, structure a YARA rule that skips these points when encountered.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts focused on the initial part of the trace and used broad patterns which may have matched unintended locations. To improve, we'll focus on more specific instruction sequences found in the traces to create bypass points.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE (specifically for EAX test with JNE)\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns involve a call sequence followed by a test of EAX, which is common across traces. By focusing on these specific sequences and their exact instruction ordering, we can create bypass points that match only where intended.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass using specific call-test-je patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF ?? ?? ?? ??
