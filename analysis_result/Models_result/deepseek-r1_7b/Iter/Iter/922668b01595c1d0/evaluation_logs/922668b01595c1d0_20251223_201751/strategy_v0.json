        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help analyze this malware trace data to find evasion bypass patterns. The user provided three traces with some specific instructions and an exit process call. My task is to extract YARA rules based on these traces.\n\nFirst, looking at the first trace: it starts with mov edi, edi, then push ebp, mov ebp, esp, calls a function (0041DF02h), then does a comparison, jumps if not equal 0x01. Then it manipulates some variables and makes two calls to another function (0042F13Ch). The second trace is similar but ends at a different call address. The third trace is identical to the first one.\n\nSince all three traces are very similar except for the exit process address, I suspect that's part of what the malware uses to terminate. The user wants me to find patterns around the evasion points where the code bypasses these checks.\n\nEach pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long and include specific instructions around the target point. Also, any address or offset bytes should be replaced with ?? using wildcard rules. Opcode and register bytes must stay concrete.\n\nLooking at the first trace:\nAfter the initial setup (mov edi, edi; push ebp), it does mov ebp, esp; calls 0041DF02h, then compares eax to 0x01h, jumps if not zero. Then moves some data, calls another function twice with offsets.\n\nSo possible bypass could involve changing the jump condition or moving past the comparison. Let's see:\n\nIn the first trace:\n- The call at E8F7250000 (call 0041DF02h) is followed by a je instruction.\n- If the code jumps, it would go to 0041B930h.\n\nBut maybe the code can bypass that by changing the jump. Or perhaps after manipulating eax, it calls two different functions which might be where the bypass occurs.\n\nWait, but since all traces terminate at ExitProcess, maybe the bypass involves making the call instruction skip or using a different offset.\n\nLooking closer:\n\nIn the first trace, after the initial setup, it does:\nE8F7250000 (call), then 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h), 7420 (je 0041B930h). So if the value of eax is not equal to 0x01h, it jumps. If the code wants to bypass this, perhaps they can change the condition or avoid jumping.\n\nBut in this trace, the code does jump because after moving some data and calling twice with different offsets, maybe eax ends up being something else? Or maybe the jump is intentional.\n\nAlternatively, looking at where the calls are made: after the je 0041B930h, it makes two calls to 0042F13Ch. Maybe if one of these functions doesn't perform a check that allows bypassing ExitProcess.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to make an unintended call elsewhere, but since it's exiting via ExitProcess, maybe they are modifying how the function returns or where it exits from.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns around the call instruction. For example, after the initial setup, a specific sequence of instructions that leads to the exit process.\n\nLet me think about each trace:\n\nTrace 1:\n- After moving ebp and esp, calls 0041DF02h.\n- Then does cmp eax, 01h; jne 0041B930h if not equal.\n- If the code wants to bypass this jump, maybe it can skip the compare or change the jump target.\n\nBut since each trace is identical except for the exit address, perhaps they are using a different function after the initial setup. Maybe the call at 0042F13Ch could be where the bypass happens.\n\nAlternatively, in the first trace, after calling 0042F13Ch twice with certain offsets, it might return to the main code or jump elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe looking for a specific sequence of instructions that leads away from ExitProcess. For example:\n\nIn all traces, they have:\nE8F72500 (call), then 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h), then jne ... if not equal.\nThen FF7508 push, call to another function.\n\nSo perhaps the bypass involves changing where this function is called or how it's executed. Or maybe using a different offset that doesn't trigger the check.\n\nBut since all three traces are similar except for the exit address, perhaps each pattern should target one of these functions at 0042F13Ch, 0042F140h, and another call point.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the function calls:\n\nIn all traces, after the initial setup, they do:\ncall dword ptr [0042F13Ch], then push eax, call dword ptr [0042F140h].\n\nSo maybe these are where the bypass can occur. For example, if the code is supposed to jump from 0041B93C directly, but instead it does something else.\n\nWait, in each trace, after the initial setup and the call, they have:\npush ebp\ncall 0042F13Ch\npush eax\ncall 0042F140h\n\nSo if those calls are bypassed or modified, perhaps that's where the exit happens.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the last few lines:\n\nIn all traces, after the two calls, they do:\n59 pop ecx\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n>>> 0041B93C call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n\nSo maybe that's where the bypass occurs. The final call is to a different address, perhaps.\n\nWait, in all three traces, they have:\n\nAt 0041B93C:\nFF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n\nBut the first and third trace also do FF15A0F14200. The second trace does FF153CF14200.\n\nSo perhaps each of these is a different function, allowing bypass at different points.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nEach pattern could be targeting one of these specific call instructions after the initial setup.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1: After the initial setup (mov edi, edi; push ebp), calls 0042F13Ch. Maybe the code can bypass this by jumping to a different instruction or changing the offset.\n\nBut since I need to create patterns based on the given trace data, perhaps each pattern should capture a specific sequence that leads away from ExitProcess.\n\nLooking at the example provided:\n\nGood Example: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n\nSo in this case, they used wildcards for address/offsets and kept opcode and register concrete.\n\nI need to apply the same logic here.\n\nLooking at each trace's instructions:\n\nIn all traces, after initial setup:\n\n0: mov edi, edi\n1: push ebp\n2: mov ebp, esp\n3: E8F72500 (call 0041DF02h)\n4: 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h)\n5: 7420 (je 0041B930h if not equal)\n\nThen:\n\n6: FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n7: FF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]\n\nSo the first pattern could be this sequence from 0 to before the jump.\n\nBut wait, in each trace, after the initial setup and calls, they do:\n\n6: push ebp\n7: call 0042F13Ch\n\nThen manipulate variables (push eax), then two more calls, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should target a specific point where the code can bypass.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each trace is similar except for the final call address, so perhaps each pattern targets one of these functions after the initial setup.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 0: After moving ebp and esp, calls to 0042F13Ch (the first function).\n\nBut how? Let's think about instruction bytes:\n\nAfter push ebp, mov ebp, esp; then E8F72500 (call), which is a call instruction.\n\nThen the next instruction is 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h). So maybe if the code can bypass this compare or change where it jumps.\n\nBut to create a pattern that captures where to jump after initial setup, but since all traces have similar steps, perhaps each pattern targets one of these specific instructions.\n\nAlternatively, considering the offset from the initial call: in the first trace, 0042F13Ch is called with an offset. If this function has code that can be bypassed, maybe by changing the displacement or address.\n\nBut since I don't have information on what's inside those functions, perhaps each pattern should target where it calls these functions.\n\nWait, but in all three traces, they call 0042F13Ch and 0042F140h. So maybe each of these is a point to bypass, leading to different exit addresses.\n\nTherefore, I can create patterns for each function:\n\nPattern 0: Targeting the first call to 0042F13Ch after initial setup.\n\nPattern 1: Targeting the second call to 0042F140h.\n\nBut wait, in the third trace, it's identical except that the final exit is at 0041B93C (same as first and third), but with a different offset. Hmm, no, actually, all three traces have the same initial setup and call sequence leading to different exit points.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern should target one of these calls after the initial setup.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 0: After moving ebp, the call at 0042F13Ch is made with a certain offset. Maybe if the code can bypass this by changing the displacement or address.\n\nBut without knowing the exact function's code, perhaps each pattern should represent where to jump from these calls.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a different instruction after calling 0042F13Ch and 0042F140h that allows them to bypass ExitProcess.\n\nWait, in all traces, after those two calls:\n\nThey do FF7508 push ebp+08h\nThen call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n\nSo perhaps the final exit is via 0042F1A0h. So maybe one of these calls can be bypassed.\n\nAlternatively, each pattern could target a different instruction in this sequence where the code can avoid the ExitProcess check.\n\nWait, but all traces have identical code except for some address or displacement bytes that are replaced with wildcards.\n\nHmm, I think I need to create three patterns, each targeting specific instructions after the initial setup. Each will be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nLet me try constructing them:\n\nPattern 0: After initial setup (mov edi, edi; push ebp), call to 0042F13Ch with displacement ?? (wildcard for offset). So something like:\n\n0041DF02h is called, then 83F801, 7420. Then FF7508 push, and call 0042F13Ch.\n\nSo the sequence would be from instruction after push ebp to before the next jump.\n\nBut perhaps a more precise pattern could capture this:\n\nFrom mov ebp, esp (instruction 2), then E8F72500 (call 0041DF02h). Then 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h). So maybe if the code can jump over these instructions or modify the comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should target a specific part of the function after initial setup. For example:\n\nPattern 0: After initial setup and before any jumps, so bytes from instruction 2 to before E8F72500 (call). That's mov ebp, esp; then call. So maybe:\n\nmov ebp, esp\nE8F72500 (call)\n\nBut that's just two instructions.\n\nWait, but I need at least six bytes for each pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first pattern captures a specific sequence after initial setup leading to a jump point where they can bypass ExitProcess.\n\nGiven all this, here are three possible patterns:\n\n1. Pattern targeting the call to 0042F13Ch with wildcards on displacement.\n2. Pattern targeting another instruction before or after that function.\n3. Pattern targeting the final exit call at 0042F1A0h.\n\nBut I need to make sure each pattern is different and captures a specific sequence of instructions where the code can bypass ExitProcess by changing addresses or displacements with wildcards.\n\nAnother approach: Since all three traces have similar steps except for the exit address, perhaps each pattern targets one of these exits. So:\n\nPattern 0: Targeting the first function call (0042F13Ch) after initial setup.\nPattern 1: Targeting the second function call (0042F140h).\nPattern 2: Targeting the final exit call (0042F1A0h).\n\nEach of these would have a specific sequence that can be bypassed, with address or displacement wildcards.\n\nLet me try to construct each pattern:\n\nPattern 0:\nAfter mov ebp, esp; E8F72500 (call), then FF7508 push, and call 0042F13Ch. So the bytes would include these steps, but with wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nBut I need to represent them as hex sequences with ?? where applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern can be structured as follows:\n\nPattern 0: {x x x ?? ?? ...} representing specific instructions after initial setup leading up to a function call.\n\nSimilarly for Patterns 1 and 2.\n\nI think it's time to outline each pattern step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo identify the Evasion bypass patterns, we analyze the provided traces focusing on instruction sequences that can lead away from the ExitProcess. Each trace has similar steps except for specific addresses, allowing us to create distinct patterns targeting these points.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific function calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = \"{83F801 7420 FF7508 FF153CF14200}\"\n        $pattern1 = \"{8B04 FF7508 FF153CF14200}\"\n        $pattern2 = \"{E8F72500 FF7508 FF153CF14200}\"\n}\n\ncount=0\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help improve the YARA bypass rule based on the given trace data and previous attempts. The initial rule didn't hit anything new, so it's clear that we need to look into the specific instructions where an evasion could occur.\n\nLooking at the traces, each one starts with a series of mov, push, and call instructions leading up to the ExitProcess call. After that, there are some conditional jumps like je and jne which might be the points where the bypass can happen.\n\nStrategy A suggests targeting the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. Since each trace starts with these instructions in the early part, maybe we can create patterns around those areas.\n\nIn the traces provided, I noticed that after the call to DF02h (E8F7250000), there's an instruction at 0041B90B which is 83F801 cmp eax, 01h. This seems like a potential target because it's right after the call and before the je or jne.\n\nSo, I can create patterns that capture these specific sequences:\n- The first pattern could be from the start of the trace up to the je at 0041B930h.\n- The second pattern might cover more bytes but still within the first 30%.\n- A third slightly different variation would help ensure coverage.\n\nBy focusing on these specific points, we can bypass the checks without causing a crash because they're targeted where the decision is made, not just executing the action. This should increase the success rate as each pattern is precise and matches only relevant code sections.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe current rule didn't find new signatures because it matched at an incorrect location (the exit call). We'll adjust to target the conditional checks before the exit decision, which are more likely to bypass safely.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: Focused on specific check points just before the exit decision, increasing specificity to avoid false positives while still matching valid evasions.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specifically targeting conditional checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC E8F7250000 83F801 C420 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC E8F7250000 FF7508 FF153CF14200 50 59 FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC E8F7250000 FF7508 FF15A0F14200 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
