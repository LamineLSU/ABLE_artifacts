      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help analyze this malware trace that's failing early due to an evasion technique. The user provided the trace data and wants me to find a way to bypass it by creating Yara rules with patterns.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the traces for each function call. There are five traces in total. Each starts with \"ExitProcess\" but at different addresses: 010A61F8, 00AF61F8, and 0040E7FF. \n\nLooking closer, the first two have similar structures around the call to a function like E825050000 or E8C8FFFFFF. The third one calls E7C3h through a different address.\n\nI need to identify where in these traces the attacker might be adding checks that the malware is trying to bypass. For example, looking at the first trace (TRACE #1), I see calls and tests on eax. Maybe there's an instruction like TEST EAX or something similar that the attacker is using as a check.\n\nIn Phase 1, from the attacker's perspective, they likely implemented checks like TEST EAX, JZ, or conditional jumps to prevent execution if certain conditions are met.\n\nPhase 2 requires me as a defender to find points where these checks can be bypassed. Maybe by skipping specific instructions that would nullify those checks.\n\nLooking at each call, perhaps I can find a consistent pattern in the code around the call function (like E8C8FFFFFF). If the attacker is pushing some data and then moving it into EAX or another register before calling, maybe there's an instruction sequence that can be skipped to bypass these tests.\n\nFor example, if the trace shows that after a certain push, there's a mov to EAX. If I skip the push, the EAX might not have been modified, thus bypassing the test.\n\nBut wait, in some traces, like Trace #3 and #4, the call is from 0040E7C3h with different parameters. Maybe the attacker used a different technique here, making it harder to find a universal bypass across all traces.\n\nSo maybe I should focus on common instructions first before each significant function call. Like after pushing some data, moving it, and then calling.\n\nLet me pick three different points where the instructions are similar enough but not identical across all traces. \n\nLooking at Trace #1, there's a call to 010A667Fh with E825050000, followed by some test and jump. Maybe I can find an instruction after a push that's used as a bypass.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker uses a specific sequence of jumps or calls that I can target. \n\nI also need to ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for addresses. Since each call seems to have a similar structure, I can create patterns by combining instructions around where the check happens.\n\nWait, in Trace #1 and #5, there's a jump or conditional after some tests. Maybe that's a good spot to bypass because if I skip those jumps, execution continues beyond the checks.\n\nSo perhaps for each target, I'll take 3-4 consecutive instructions, include wildcards where necessary, and create patterns that match these sequences.\n\nI have to make sure the patterns are specific enough but not too long. Each pattern should represent a distinct point in the code where an instruction can be skipped without affecting functionality beyond that point.\n\nAlright, let me try to outline three possible bypass points:\n\n1. After a TEST EAX instruction, skipping the next conditional jump.\n2. After a push and mov instruction before a call, skipping the push.\n3. A specific conditional jump that's used as an evasion check, which I can skip by altering the condition.\n\nEach of these needs to be translated into Yara patterns with wildcards for any address or offset, keeping the opcode and registers concrete.\n\nI'll need to ensure that each pattern is unique but captures a different part of the code. Also, make sure that each bypass point targets specific instructions so that they can be identified in the trace.\n</think>\n\nHere are three distinct Yara rules based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta: description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for sandbox detection\"\n    cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 FF C3 FF ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 12 } # Bypass after TEST EAX\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE 85 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? } # Bypass after PUSH and MOV\n        $pattern2 = { A8 01 FF 75 08 FF 75 08 FF 74 07 } # Bypass after conditional jump\n}\n\n    condition: any_of_them\n}\n```\n\nEach pattern is designed to capture specific sequences in the trace where an instruction can be skipped, thus bypassing the detection mechanism.",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct this Yara rule based on the user's analysis. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original Yara rule was missing some parts like the description and didn't follow all the requirements. The user mentioned that the previous attempt failed because it didn't have 3 different patterns with specific instructions each, and also the wildcards were used correctly for address bytes.\n\nLooking at the validation errors, I see that the rule wasn't generating a correct bypass pattern requirement (BPPR). Also, the strings section was using $pattern0 which is not valid. The meta section was missing the description and other necessary fields like cape_options.\n\nThe user's reasoning included looking at the traces to find where the bypass occurs. From the trace data, it seems that each trace has different patterns: some have E8C8FFFF, others have 0F8433FDFFFF or something else. So, I should pick three distinct patterns from these traces.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for addresses and offsets. For example, in the first trace, the call after E8C8FFFF could be replaced with wildcards around it. Similarly, other calls can be captured by including their surrounding instructions.\n\nAnother thing is that each pattern should represent a different part of the code execution flow to avoid duplication. So I'll pick three unique patterns from different traces or positions within the same trace.\n\nI also need to include the cape_options in the meta section so that Yara knows it's an evasion bypass rule and what parameters to use for it.\n\nPutting this all together, I'll create three distinct hex patterns with wildcards, each 6-20 bytes long, ensuring they capture specific instructions from the traces. Then, I'll format them correctly within the yara rule template.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule using multiple bypass points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user correct their Yara rule based on the provided information and the analysis done. The original rule didn't meet all the requirements, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: the rule is missing the `cape_options` structure in meta, which is crucial for the bypass to work. Also, each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long and consist of hexadecimal instructions with wildcards where necessary.\n\nThe user provided some trace data from an execution analysis. I should analyze this trace to identify the evasion points and create patterns based on that.\n\nLooking at the traces, I notice calls to `E8_C7`, `E8_5A`, etc. These seem like potential bypass points. The goal is to find three different patterns where these evasions are being bypassed.\n\nFor each pattern, I need to include two or more consecutive instructions with wildcards for addresses or offsets. Also, ensure that each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and includes the target instruction plus context.\n\nLet me start by identifying three distinct points from the trace:\n\n1. The first trace has a call at `E8_C7`. Let's create a pattern around this.\n2. The second trace also uses `E8_5A`, which is different enough for another pattern.\n3. The third trace has a call at `E8_E3`, making it suitable for the third pattern.\n\nNow, I'll construct each pattern:\n\n1. For the first pattern, combine the test and call instructions with surrounding context. Use wildcards where necessary to keep it specific.\n2. Similarly, create the second and third patterns ensuring they are unique and meet the length requirement.\n\nI also need to include the `cape_options` in the meta section, referencing each pattern as $pattern0, $pattern1, etc., along with their actions (all set to skip) and a count of 3.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure that all hexadecimal bytes are correctly formatted with spaces between them and that wildcards (`??`) replace any address or offset bytes.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting multiple dynamic addresses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=3\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
