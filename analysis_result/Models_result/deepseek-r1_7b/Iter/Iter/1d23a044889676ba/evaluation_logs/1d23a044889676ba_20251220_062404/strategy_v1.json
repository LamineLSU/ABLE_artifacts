Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help the user by evolving a YARA bypass rule based on their feedback and analysis of an Excel trace sample. Let me break down what they've provided.\n\nFirst, the user mentioned that their current best rule has 0 new signatures, so I need to come up with three new patterns from the given traces. The goal is to create specific but generic patterns that can bypass the exit process effectively.\n\nLooking at the traces, both have similar structures: they call a function (E7F6) which leads to an exit via E7FF. So, maybe the first pattern should target this call and see if it's followed by a jump or something else before the exit.\n\nIn Strategy A, it was about checking in the first 30% of the trace. But since the rule didn't hit, perhaps I need a more specific location after the call but before the exit. Maybe right after E7F6, looking for an unconditional\u8df3\u8f6c like jmp\u6216\u8005jg\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u3002\n\nNext, Strategy B suggests looking at the exit decision. Since the exit is called, maybe there's something else that can be bypassed. Like checking if the exit has a conditional and then finding another way out.\n\nFor Strategy C, timing techniques might not apply here since it's deterministic based on the trace. So perhaps I'll stick to instruction patterns.\n\nNow, trying to find three different 6-20 byte patterns from the traces:\n\n1. The first pattern could be right after E7F6: jmp ?4?C3h, which is a jump to E7C3h if it's not zero.\n2. The second pattern might look for a comparison before the call or exit. For example, cmp eax,?00000001 and then jg ?0000089Ch would mean jumping after comparing with 0x1.\n3. The third pattern could be after E7FF: mov ?2A000000,?5B500000h. This seems specific but maybe too generic.\n\nWait, I should make sure all these patterns exist in the trace and use exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts.\n\nSo putting it together, each pattern is 6-20 bytes, uses wildcards where necessary, and covers different aspects of the exit process.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe original rule failed to hit due to patterns being too generic or located in the wrong part of the trace. The updated patterns are more specific to the call and jump sequences before the exit, increasing the likelihood they bypass without matching incorrect locations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: \n1. **CALL AND JUMP CHECK (60% success)** - Location: RIGHT AFTER THE CALL E7F6\n2. **CONDITIONAL CHECK BEFORE EXIT (25% success)** - Location: BEFORE THE CONDITIONAL CHECK THAT TRIGGERS THE EXIT\n3. **SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE (15% success)** - Location: AFTER THE EXIT CALL\n\n**REASONING**: \nThese patterns are more specific to the call and jump sequences before the exit, increasing the likelihood they bypass without matching incorrect locations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D00100074128B4D }\n        $pattern2 = { RDTSC 0A3F8C200603ECBF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

The third candidate could be another point in the trace where instructions change.\n\nI'll need to create patterns around these points, making sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long and includes wildcards for any address or offset bytes.\n\nLet me draft three patterns:\n\n1. Around E8C8FFFFFF: Combine this with surrounding instructions.\n2. A different FF7508 instruction from one of the traces to avoid duplication.\n3. Another unique set of instructions that vary in the trace.\n\nI'll replace all hex bytes that are addresses or offsets with ?? and keep opcode and registers concrete.\n\nLet me make sure each pattern is unique and meets the length requirement.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC E8 ?? ?? ?? ??
