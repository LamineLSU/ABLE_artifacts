Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace information and previous attempts. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the task context, we're dealing with a sample called 1d23a044889676ba, which is being used in a malware evasion scenario. The goal is to bypass the exit process efficiently. \n\nFrom the latest attempt analysis, it seems that the rule didn't hit because of an error during generation. So I need to figure out what went wrong and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe original trace has two entries where ExitProcess is called at different offsets: 0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF. Each of these calls leads to the same function, probably the exit routine. The last instruction before exiting in both cases seems to be a call to another address (0040E7C3h for the first trace and 0041B0ACh for the second). \n\nIn the current best rule, nothing was found because it's supposed to hit but didn't, which suggests that maybe the pattern is either not specific enough or too broad. Since we're advised to be specific yet flexible, I should look for patterns in the trace.\n\nLooking at STRATEGY A: It checks the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX and a JE/JNE instruction. This could target an exit check function. \n\nFor STRATEGY B: It looks before the exit call, checking for conditional logic that might bypass the actual exit process.\n\nGiven the trace, both exits have similar structures with the same last instructions but different offsets. So perhaps the bypass should be applied at these specific points where the exit is called.\n\nI need to create three patterns based on the trace data:\n\n1. The first pattern could target the initial part of ExitProcess, looking for a JE/JNE after TEST EAX.\n2. The second pattern might look for conditional checks before the call to 0040E7C3h or another specific instruction.\n3. The third pattern could focus on unique instruction sequences that bypass the exit logic.\n\nEach pattern needs to be exactly 6-20 bytes, using exact hex values from the trace where possible and wildcards (??) for varying offsets.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is different and covers distinct parts of the trace to increase specificity without being too narrow. This way, they can target specific vulnerabilities in the exit process.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts likely failed because the bypass rule was either not specific enough or didn't account for variations in the exit process. By creating three distinct patterns based on different parts of the trace and focusing on specific instruction sequences, we increase the likelihood of hitting the target without causing errors.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, CONDITION_CHECK, UNIQUEInstrSeq\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80 (high confidence after considering variations)\n\n**REASONING**: Using three distinct patterns for different parts of the trace increases specificity. Each pattern is designed to target specific instruction sequences that bypass the exit process efficiently.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved using multiple strategies\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D0010 00 00 0F82 ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
