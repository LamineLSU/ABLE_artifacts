      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix the YARA rule for bypass evasion based on the provided trace data. Let's start by understanding what was wrong in the previous attempt.\n\nFirst, there were two main errors: a missing action definition and an insufficient number of context bytes after a pattern. The initial rule had actions only defined for bp0, but they didn't specify what to do (like skip). Also, one of the patterns wasn't long enough—it only had 4 bytes after the opcode, which isn't enough because CAPE needs at least 6 bytes around the target instruction.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I see that there are several call instructions and other operations. My task is to extract three different patterns from this trace, each being between 6-20 bytes long. Each pattern should include wildcards for addresses or offsets and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nLet me identify potential patterns in the trace:\n\n1. The first notable instruction is E8 at offset 432814h. Following that are some calls and a test. Maybe I can take E8 plus the next few instructions as one pattern.\n   \n   - E8 followed by ?? for the offset bytes, then other operations.\n\n2. Another call happens at E8E0FFFF, which is another target point. This could be the second pattern, combining this call with surrounding context.\n\n3. There's also a call at B7F7FFFF and E8B7F7FFFF; perhaps taking one of these as the third pattern.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and meets the length requirement. Let me draft three patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: The first E8 instruction with surrounding operations, ensuring it's around 6 bytes.\n2. Pattern 1: Another call (E8E0FFFF) that includes more context but still fits within 20 bytes.\n3. Pattern 2: Maybe a different call elsewhere in the trace.\n\nNow, I'll create each pattern using wildcards for address/offsets and keeping opcodes concrete where possible. Also, make sure each is at least 6 bytes long.\n\nLet me check if all three patterns are unique and fit within the byte limit.\n</think>\n\nTo correct the YARA rule, we've extracted three distinct patterns from the trace data, ensuring they meet the required length and include wildcards for address/offsets. The `cape_options` now correctly references these patterns with actions set to `skip`.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8E0A2FFFF 85C0 740E ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { B7F7F7FFFF 6A ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help improve the Yara bypass rule based on the feedback from the previous attempt. Let's start by understanding what went wrong in the first iteration.\n\nIn the first attempt, the rule caused a crash because it matched an incorrect location in the trace. The original trace had specific instructions that were used as patterns in the initial rule. It seems like the pattern was too broad or matched where it wasn't supposed to, leading to a crash when it shouldn't have.\n\nLooking at the trace provided, there are several calls and checks happening before the exit process. I need to identify potential bypass points where an evasion could occur without triggering the actual exit.\n\nStrategy A suggests looking in the first 30% of the trace for a call followed by a test on EAX and a jump instruction (JE/JNE). Strategy B is about checking conditions before the exit, which might involve conditional calls or checks. Strategy C looks for unique techniques like timing or specific instructions that are harder to detect.\n\nSince the previous attempt failed because it matched an incorrect location, maybe moving earlier in the trace would help. The first 30% could be a good place since that's where many of the setup steps occur before exiting.\n\nI should look at the instructions and find sequences that fit the strategies without being too broad. Maybe focusing on specific test+JE patterns or conditional checks before exits.\n\nLet me scan through the trace:\n\n- The trace starts with pushing EBP, then moving to an address (004326F8h). Then it calls two functions: 00419700h and 0041F4A0h. After that, there are several test+je instructions.\n\nLooking at the specific hex bytes:\n\n- The first test is at 00421417 with E8431C0000 (call) followed by 740E (je). Then another call at 0042141D, then 0042141B.\n\nSo perhaps the first occurrence after the initial setup is a good target for Strategy A. Maybe the pattern starts with E8431C0000 (call) followed by test and je.\n\nAnother possible spot is before the exit process itself, maybe checking if there's an unconditional call that can be bypassed earlier.\n\nI should also consider using wildcards where offsets vary to make the patterns more specific but not too restrictive. Each pattern needs to cover a different part of the trace to avoid matching unintended locations.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns based on these observations, ensuring they fit into the strategies mentioned and use exact hex values where possible with wildcards for variability.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The initial rule matched an incorrect location in the trace, leading to a crash. By applying Strategy A (Evasion Check), we can target earlier steps before the exit decision, using specific test+JE patterns that are less likely to match unintended locations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: Using more specific patterns from the first 30% of the trace increases the likelihood of hitting a valid bypass point while reducing false positives. This strategy focuses on known setup steps that are common before exit, making the bypass more reliable.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific test+JE patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 740E E8431C0000 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85C0 740E E8EE82FFFF }\n        $pattern2 = { 85C0 740E E8B7F7FFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThis rule uses three distinct test+JE patterns from the trace's initial setup steps, each with specific hex values to increase specificity and reduce false matches.",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help create a better YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me go through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the history: The first attempt used \"bypass_crashed\" which caused a crash because it hit 'exec_crash'. The second attempt with \"rule_hit\" didn't find any new signatures, meaning the rule was correct but not effective enough. So, I need to refine the pattern to avoid hitting the same issues.\n\nThe original trace shows that after some calls and tests, there's an exit process instruction at 0042142B. The goal is to bypass this exit point successfully.\n\nFrom the STRATEGY A explanation, it suggests targeting a check function before the exit, specifically looking for CALL → TEST EAX → JE/JNE. This makes sense because if we can intercept and bypass the check without executing the test or jumping away, the program should continue running.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- The first few instructions are calls: 00421408 is a call to 00419700h, then 0042140D is another call, and so on.\n- Then we see TEST EAX (00421417) followed by JE or JNE.\n\nWait, in the trace:\n- At line 00421417: TEST EAX, then line 00421419 is JE 00421429h. Then another call at 00421420 TEST EAX and JE again.\n\nSo the exit process happens after these checks. If we can bypass this check before it gets to the exit, that would work.\n\nIn the first attempt, maybe the rule was too broad or didn't account for where exactly the bypass should occur. Since the second attempt hit but found no new signatures, perhaps the pattern matched at a wrong location. \n\nSo I need to make sure the pattern is specific enough to match only before the exit instruction and not elsewhere.\n\nLooking at Strategy A again: Location is the first 30% of the trace. So maybe we should adjust how early we check or where exactly in that section we look.\n\nAlso, considering the critical note about patterns needing to come directly from the trace data, I have to ensure each pattern's bytes are exact matches from the given trace.\n\nLet me examine possible patterns based on the trace:\n\n1. The first JE is at 00421419: JE 00421429h\n   - The instruction before it is TEST EAX (00421417), then E8E0A2FFFF which is a call to 0041B700h.\n\nSo the sequence around there is:\n- Call to some function, then TEST EAX, then JE.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe after the first JE, it's called with an argument that leads to another check. \n\nBut in Strategy C, they mention looking for unique instruction sequences like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detect, but since the previous attempts didn't work, maybe focusing on Strategy A is better.\n\nSo perhaps I can create a pattern that skips the first JE after TEST EAX before proceeding to the exit.\n\nLet me outline possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1: After TEST EAX and JE, skip the next instruction. So the bypass would be at the JE instruction's next byte, causing it to jump over the test and proceed.\n\nBut in YARA, how do we represent this? The pattern should match right before the JE instruction so that the bypass can occur after that point without executing the test.\n\nWait, actually, if we have a condition where after TEST EAX and JE, we skip the next instruction. So maybe something like:\n\n- After TEST EAX (0x85 C0), followed by JB or JE with an offset that skips over the exit.\n\nLooking at the trace, after the first TEST EAX (00421417) is E8E0A2FFFF which is a call to 0041B700h. Then comes another TEST EAX and JE again.\n\nWait, maybe if we can create a pattern that detects when a call is made after TEST EAX, then jumps over it without executing the test or the subsequent JE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a conditional jump in the bypass rule to skip past certain instructions based on the trace bytes.\n\nAnother approach: Since the exit process happens at 0042142B via a call dword ptr [00432814h], maybe we can create a pattern that detects when this call is made and skips it, thus bypassing the exit.\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe by checking for the specific instruction before the call. In the trace, right before the call at 0042142B, there's E8431C0000 which is a mov of ESI from offset 0x55h (probably some string or data). Then comes the call.\n\nSo maybe we can find an instruction before that call where if it occurs, we bypass it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on bypassing the initial JE instructions. Let me think about the specific bytes in Strategy A: The pattern would be a call to something, followed by TEST EAX, then JE. We need to create a pattern that skips these steps.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the trace and see if there are specific points where we can insert a bypass.\n\nAnother idea: Use a conditional move or jump after TEST EAX but before the JE. So in YARA, this would involve checking for the TEST EAX instruction followed by a JB or JE with an offset that skips past the exit.\n\nBut since the previous attempts failed due to rule hits without new signatures, maybe we need more specific patterns. For example, using wildcards where necessary and exact bytes elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, consider looking at the call dword ptr [00432814h] near the end of the trace. If this is executed when it shouldn't be, perhaps bypassing that instruction would work.\n\nWait, in the original trace:\n\n- Line 0042142B: call dword ptr [00432814h]\n\nSo maybe if we can detect a jump or a conditional move before that call and skip it. For example, after some specific instructions like TEST EAX, we cause an unconditional jump to bypass the problematic code.\n\nBut I'm not sure how common that would be. Alternatively, perhaps using a RDTSC instruction in the pattern to detect timing differences, but since previous attempts didn't work, maybe that's not helpful now.\n\nAnother approach: Since after each test and JE there's a call, maybe we can find an offset or specific instruction that can be jumped over based on the trace. For example, if after TEST EAX and JE, there's a call to another function with a known address, we could jump past it.\n\nBut in this case, the calls seem to vary, so using wildcards might help avoid false positives.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the best approach is to create three specific patterns based on the trace where the bypass can occur after certain instructions like TEST EAX followed by JE or conditional jumps. Each pattern will target a different part of the code flow, ensuring that we don't repeat the same failure points and increase specificity.\n\nSo, finalizing three patterns:\n\n1. After TEST EAX (0x85 C0) with an offset to skip the next instruction.\n2. A conditional jump after a call where the test is avoided.\n3. Skipping over specific offset calls before reaching the exit process.\n\nEach of these will be translated into YARA rules, ensuring that they are exact matches from the trace and use wildcards for variable parts like offsets to prevent false positives.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The analysis involved understanding previous failed attempts and refining the bypass patterns to target specific points in the code flow where the exit process occurs. By focusing on the first 30% of the trace, we identified potential points after TEST EAX and JE instructions. Each pattern is designed to skip these critical sections without causing false positives by using exact trace bytes and wildcards for variable parts.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 85\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns are crafted to specifically bypass the code after TEST EAX and JE, targeting the decision points before the exit process. Using precise byte sequences from the trace ensures that the bypass is effective without matching unintended locations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - tailored to specific code exit points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 E8E0A2FFFF }\n        $pattern1 = { 85C0 E8431C0000 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A00 E8431C0000 }\n}\n\npattern0: bytes\n 85 C0 E8 E0 A2 FFFF\n\npattern1: bytes\n 85 C0 8B 45 FC 55 ??\n\npattern2: bytes\n 6A00 8B 45 FC 55 ??\n```",
