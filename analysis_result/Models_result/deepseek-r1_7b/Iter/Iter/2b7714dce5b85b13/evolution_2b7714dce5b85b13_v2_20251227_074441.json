      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an evasion bypass rule for this Yara analysis. The user provided some trace data with five different traces where the program exits early due to sandbox or VM evasion. My goal is to find a way to detect when these evasions happen by analyzing the instruction sequences.\n\nFirst, let me look at the first two traces. Both exit at 0x55F8 and then call dword ptr [0x15A12Ch]. Hmm, that's interesting. So both of them have similar call instructions after exiting early. Maybe I can find a common pattern there.\n\nLooking closer at the first trace (TRACE #1), right before the exit, there are some test and je instructions. The program does a test on EAX and jumps to 0x5E83h if it's not zero. Then it moves some data into EBP and pushes EAX. It also calls a function at 0x5C17h.\n\nIn the second trace (TRACE #2), the exit is similar but happens at 0x61F8, with the same call to dword ptr [0x15A12Ch]. The structure before that involves some pushes and pops, like pushing EAX and moving EBX. Then it calls a function at 0x5C17h as well.\n\nI notice that both traces have a call instruction right after exiting early. Maybe the bypass is happening when this call is skipped or modified. So perhaps if we can find a way to skip the initial exit or make it go into the je conditional jump, the program would continue instead of exiting.\n\nLet me think about possible instructions where an attacker could create a bypass. The first trace has a series of push and pop operations around line 0x5C17h. Maybe if we can skip pushing EAX or modifying the stack, it might prevent the exit. Similarly, in the second trace, there are push and pop operations on EBX.\n\nI should consider specific instructions that could be causing these exits. For example, the call instruction at offset 0x5C17h is crucial here. If an attacker can bypass this call or modify its behavior, they might prevent the exit.\n\nWait, in both traces, after the test and je, there's a push on EAX and then a call to another function. Maybe if we can skip these pushes or changes, it would allow the program to continue instead of exiting.\n\nSo, focusing on the first trace: right before the exit, there are several instructions that could be bypassed. For example, skipping the push of EAX at line 0x5A and moving it elsewhere might prevent the test from being executed as intended.\n\nSimilarly, in the second trace, skipping pushing EBX or modifying the stack around 0x5C17h could help bypass the call there.\n\nI think I can create patterns that target these specific points. Let's try to outline them:\n\n1. Pattern #1: Bypassing the initial test and je by skipping the push of EAX.\n2. Pattern #2: Bypassing the function call at 0x5C17h by having a different offset or modifying the jump.\n3. Pattern #3: Another point where an instruction is modified, such as popping EBX after a push.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers enough instructions with wildcards for address/offset bytes so that it's specific but flexible enough to match various evasions.\n\nLet me draft some hex patterns based on these observations. I'll include the necessary context before the target instruction, use wildcards where appropriate, and keep the opcode and register bytes concrete.\n\nAfter considering all this, here are three distinct bypass patterns:\n\n1. Skipping EAX push in the first trace.\n2. Modifying the function call offset slightly in both traces.\n3. Bypassing EBX pop in the second trace.\n\nEach pattern is 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for address/offsets and concrete opcode/register bytes.\n</think>\n\nTo detect early exits caused by sandbox evasion, we analyze the provided traces to find instruction patterns that could be bypassed. By identifying these points of divergence, we craft specific hex patterns targeting each scenario.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionBypass {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection using trace analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A5B 5A8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85C0 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF75 08E1 ?? ?? ?? ??

They've tried a YARA pattern that didn't match, so now they need to come up with improved rules using specific patterns from their trace data.\n\nFirst, I look at the provided trace data for the sample. It's quite extensive, with multiple calls and jumps in TRACE #1. The user mentioned they're trying to bypass malware evasion, which likely involves evading exit process checks or exploiting certain decision points before program termination.\n\nThey've tried Strategy A first but it didn't work, so now they need to consider Strategies B and C. Since the previous attempt matched but no new signatures were found, I suspect the pattern was applied in the wrong location—maybe too early, like at the start of the trace instead of right before an exit or conditional jump.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I notice several places where the code jumps to handle certain conditions. For example, after the first few instructions, there's a call to 001561F8 which might be part of the exit process. This could be a good target for the bypass rule because it's near where the program exits.\n\nI then consider specific patterns that could match these jump and test instructions without being too generic. The idea is to find unique instruction sequences that are likely to trigger the bypass but don't appear elsewhere in the trace. \n\nFor example, looking at the first part of TRACE #1:\n- 0015617A: test eax, eax\n- 0015617C: je 00156190h\n\nThis is a typical JE instruction after a TEST EAX. This sequence could be targeted because it's part of the exit check before proceeding.\n\nAnother point in the trace has:\n- 00156214: mov esp, ebp\n- 00156216: pop ebp\n\nThis is part of the program counter manipulation right before exiting. This might be a good spot for another bypass pattern since it's directly related to the exit.\n\nLastly, looking at:\n- 0015621D: mov esp, ebp\n- 0015621F: pop ebp\n\nThis is similar but occurs later in the trace. It seems like an unusual place because the program counter isn't jumping here as frequently, making it a better target for bypass.\n\nBy focusing on these specific sequences and ensuring each pattern is unique and precise, I can create effective YARA rules that are more likely to bypass the evasion without causing errors from matching unrelated parts of the trace.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe previous attempt did not yield new signatures because it matched a pattern too early in the trace. The exit-related checks or decision points occur later in the code, so we need to target these specific locations with more precise patterns.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: \n- Strategy A: Exit check bypass (early in the trace) - already tried\n- Strategy B: Exit decision before termination (mid-trace)\n- Strategy C: Unusual instruction sequence (later in the trace)\n\n**REASONING**: \nBy focusing on specific sequences just before exit or program termination, we can create patterns that are more likely to bypass the evasion without being too generic.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeting mid-trace exit decisions and specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C074128B85F0FEFFFF }  # TEST EAX followed by JE - mid-trace\n        $pattern1 = { B9B5FCFFFF6A40111500 }   # Unusual program counter manipulation\n        $pattern2 = { C3C9E84B1700A15150 }    # Another unusual instruction sequence at later mid-trace\n\n    condition:\n        (matches $pattern0) || (matches $pattern1) || (matches $pattern2)\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct this Yara rule based on the given trace data and the previous incorrect attempt. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: each pattern is too short (4 bytes), which is way below the required 6-20 bytes. Also, the patterns are using hardcoded values like 85C0, which shouldn't be there because they're specific addresses and should be replaced with wildcards to avoid triggering new signatures.\n\nThe original incorrect rule had three patterns, each only 4 bytes long. That's way too short, so I need to expand them by adding more instructions around the target points. Each pattern needs to include enough context from adjacent instructions to make it longer but still specific enough for Yara to match without being too broad.\n\nLooking at the trace data, let me identify possible bypass points where the program is exiting early due to a call instruction or a conditional jump. The idea is to capture sequences around these calls so that if those are skipped (actions 0,1,2 set to skip), the program continues execution instead of exiting.\n\nFor each pattern, I'll take an instruction from the trace and include two more instructions before and after it. For example, if a call instruction is at address X, I'll capture the three bytes before and after the 4-byte offset, making sure to replace any hardcoded addresses with wildcards (??).\n\nLet me start by identifying potential bypass points:\n\n1. The first pattern could be around the E825050000 call in TRACE #1 at line 9. So, capturing the three bytes before and after: 8BCE (mov), then E825050000, then next few instructions. But I need to make sure it's only specific enough by adding wildcards for address offsets.\n\nWait, no, the instruction is E825050000, which is a call with an offset of 0x050000. So, in the pattern, after E8 comes ?? for the four-byte offset, then the next few instructions like 899DF0FEFFFF.\n\nSo Pattern 0 would be: 8BCE (E8 + ...), followed by E825050000 with four wildcards, and then some context bytes. But wait, maybe I should capture more surrounding instructions to make the pattern longer but still specific.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for another instruction in the trace that exits early due to a call or conditional jump. For example, looking at TRACE #2, there are E825050000 and E9B5FCFFFF. Maybe I can find sequences around these calls.\n\nAnother approach is to take each of the three patterns from the original incorrect rule and expand them by adding more context.\n\nOriginal Pattern 0: $pattern0 = { 85C0+0, action=skip,bp=0 }\n\nBut this only has four bytes. So I can add previous instructions like 8BCE (E8 + ...), then E825050000 with wildcards.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be: 8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF, making it longer by combining three instructions into one pattern.\n\nWait, no. Let me think about the structure. Each pattern should consist of multiple consecutive bytes, including opcodes and operands where possible, with address/offsets replaced by wildcards.\n\nSo for Pattern 0:\n\nTake the instruction before the target (8BCE), then the target (E8 ?? ????), followed by some context instructions like E9B5FCFFFF. That would make a longer pattern.\n\nBut I need to ensure that each pattern is exactly six bytes or more. Let me structure each pattern as follows: capture two or three consecutive instructions, including the target and surrounding bytes where possible.\n\nPattern 0:\n- 8BCE (mov ecx, esi)\n- E825050000 (call ...)\n- ?? ?? for four-byte offset\n- Then some context like 899DF0FEFFFF\n\nSo in hex: {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF}\n\nWait, that's six bytes? No, it's more. Each instruction is two or three bytes depending on the opcode.\n\nAlternatively, each pattern should be a sequence of 6-20 bytes. So combining multiple instructions into one pattern.\n\nAnother example: The original incorrect Pattern1 was E825050000 with ?? for offset and some context. Maybe I can expand it by adding more instructions before or after.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to take each of the three patterns from the initial rule and expand them by including adjacent instructions, ensuring that all address/offsets are replaced with wildcards.\n\nSo Pattern 0: Take E825050000 (call), include previous instruction 8BCE, then some context. So it would be 8BCE E8 ?? ???? ????\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list out the exact instructions from each trace and see where a call or conditional jump occurs.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1:\n- At line 9: E825050000 (call) followed by some context.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be around this instruction, capturing the three bytes before and after to make it longer.\n\nSimilarly for other traces. Each call or conditional jump can be a target point.\n\nI think I need to create three separate patterns, each starting with an instruction from the trace data, expanding into surrounding instructions where possible, ensuring all address/offsets are replaced with ??.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 0: Around E825050000 in TRACE #1\nPattern 1: Around E9B5FCFFFF in TRACE #2\nPattern 2: Around E8C8FFFFFF in TRACE #3\n\nEach pattern will capture the instruction before and after, with wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nNow, I'll try to structure each pattern as follows:\n\nPattern 0:\n- Before: 8BCE (E8 + ...)\n- Target: E825050000 (call with offset)\n- After: Some context instructions\n\nSo in hex: {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF}\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes. I need to include more.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern should be exactly six bytes or longer but not exceeding 20 bytes. So combining multiple instructions into one pattern, including the target and surrounding context.\n\nAnother approach: Each pattern will consist of two consecutive calls with wildcards for their offsets and some context after them.\n\nBut I think it's better to take three consecutive instructions around each call point to create a unique enough pattern while still being specific.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 0:\n- E8 (call) followed by ?? for the four-byte offset, then next instruction is 899DF0FEFFFF. So combining with previous instruction 8BCE: {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF}\n\nPattern 1:\n- Around another call in a different trace.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the instructions:\n\nIn TRACE #3 and #4, there's an E8C8FFFFFF call. Maybe that can be a target.\n\nSo Pattern 2 could be around that instruction.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look for an example pattern from the user's previous attempt. They had three patterns each with four bytes, so expanding them by adding context would make them longer.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern0: {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF} (6 bytes)\nPattern1: {E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83C4 ??} (but this is only 5, so maybe add more)\nPattern2: {6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ??} (too short)\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is at least six bytes. So let me adjust:\n\nPattern0: {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF} (6 bytes)\nPattern1: {E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83C4 ?? ????} (maybe longer by adding more instructions)\nWait, no, each pattern must be contiguous. So I can capture a few more instructions after the target.\n\nLet me try to create three patterns:\n\nPattern0:\n- E825050000 call\n- Previous instruction: 8BCE\n- Context: next few instructions\n\nSo combining them: {8BCE E8 ?? ???? ??? ????} (but I need exact hex)\n\nBut perhaps it's better to represent each pattern as a sequence of two or three consecutive instructions, including the target and surrounding bytes.\n\nWait, maybe an example from the user was:\n\nGood Example: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\n\nThat's nine bytes. So perhaps I can structure each pattern to be around four- five bytes long.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the call instruction and its surrounding context.\n\nBut I think it's best to take each of the three target calls from the trace data, expand them by including two or three instructions before and after, with wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern0: Around E825050000 in TRACE #1\n- 8BCE (mov)\n- E825050000 (call)\n- ?? ?? (four-byte offset)\n- 899DF0FEFFFF\n\nCombined as {8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF}\n\nPattern1: Around E9B5FCFFFF in TRACE #2\n- 0F843CE1700 (push)\n- E9B5FCFFFF (call)\n- ?? ?? (four-byte offset)\n- 8D8DF8FEFFFF\n\nSo {0F84 3C E1 70 00 E9B5 FC ???? 8D8D F8 FE FFFF}\n\nWait, but how to structure this as a single pattern.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern1: {E9B5FCFFFF ?? ??? ????} but that's too short. Maybe combine with previous and next instructions.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.\n\nEach pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, include the target instruction plus surrounding context where possible, all address/offsets replaced with wildcards.\n\nSo for each call or conditional jump in the trace, capture a few preceding and following instructions as a single pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern0: E825050000 (call) with four-byte offset wildcard, along with previous instruction 8BCE and next instruction 899DF0FEFFFF. So combining these three into one pattern would be {8BCE E8 ?? ???? 899DF0FEFFFF} which is more than six bytes.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\n- 8BCE: two bytes\n- E825050000: four bytes (call with four-byte offset)\nBut wait, the call instruction itself is five bytes: E8 25 05 00 00. So that would be a longer pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent each instruction as their hex values and include them in the pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\nE825050000 as E8 25 05 00 00 (but that's five bytes). Then previous instruction is 8BCE: two bytes. Next instruction is 899DF0FEFFFF: four bytes.\n\nSo combining all of them into a single pattern would be:\n\n{8BCE E8 25 05 ?? ???}\n\nBut this might not capture enough context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should consist of the target call plus two or three surrounding instructions with wildcards on address/offsets.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to structure each pattern as a sequence of two consecutive calls and their offsets, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, in the trace data, there are multiple calls:\n\n- E825050000\n- E9B5FCFFFF\n- E8C8FFFFFF\n\nEach can be a target. So I'll create three patterns around each call.\n\nPattern0: Around E825050000 (from TRACE #1)\n- 8BCE (mov)\n- E825050000 (call with offset)\n- ?? ???? (wildcards for four-byte offset)\n- Next instruction: 899DF0FEFFFF\n\nSo the pattern would be: {8BCE E825050000's bytes, then wildcards and next instructions}\n\nBut in hex:\n\nE8 is 0xE8, 25 is 0x25, 05 is 0x05, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each instruction as their full byte sequence. For example:\n\n- E8: [E8]\n- 25: [25]\n- 05: [05]\n- 00: [00]\n- 00: [00]\n\nBut that would make the pattern too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each call is a single instruction with four-byte offset, so including it in the pattern along with previous and next instructions.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to create one pattern as an example:\n\nPattern0:\n- E825050000: 0xE8, 0x25, 0x05, 0x00, 0x00\nBut that's five bytes. Including previous instruction (8BCE) and next instruction (899DF0FEFFFF):\n\nSo the pattern would be:\n\n{0x8B CE E8 25 05 00 00 ???} but I need to capture more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each call is a separate pattern with surrounding context.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to take each instruction from the trace and create three patterns around them. For example:\n\nPattern0: The first instruction that exits (E825050000) surrounded by two instructions before and after.\nPattern1: Another exit point in a different trace.\nPattern2: Third exit point.\n\nEach pattern would include these with wildcards for any address/offsets.\n\nSo, for Pattern0:\n\n- Previous instruction: 8BCE\n- Target: E825050000 (five bytes)\n- Next instructions: some context\n\nCombined as {8BCE E8 25 05 ?? ???}\n\nBut this is more than six bytes. Let me count the bytes:\n\nEach instruction in hex:\n\nE8 (1 byte), 25 (1), 05 (1), 00 (1), 00 (1). Previous instruction: 8BCE is two bytes.\n\nSo total so far: 2 + 5 =7 bytes. Maybe add the next instruction after that to make it longer.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to structure this correctly without making it too long or too short.\n\nI think I need to accept that each pattern will be around six-20 bytes and include enough context from surrounding instructions, replacing address/offsets with wildcards.\n\nAfter struggling a bit, here's my final attempt:\n\nPattern 0: Around E825050000 in TRACE #1\n{8BCE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 899DF0FEFFFF}\n\nPattern 1: Around E9B5FCFFFF in TRACE #2\n{E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8D8DF8FEFFFF}\n\nWait, but that's only five bytes.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to include more instructions around each call point.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern0:\n- Previous instruction: 8BCE (E8 + ...)\n- Call: E825050000\n- Wildcards for offset\n- Next instruction: next few bytes\n\nSo combining these, the pattern would be {8BCE E825050000's bytes with wildcards and next instructions}\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nI think it's time to provide three patterns each of 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for addresses/offsets, capturing surrounding context.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8BCE E8 ?? ???? }\n        $pattern1 = { ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 6A5B 5A EC E8 CE ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { E874 ?? 01 ?? ?? ?? ?? 03C9 FF ?? ?? }\n}\n\ncondition = any of them\n```",
