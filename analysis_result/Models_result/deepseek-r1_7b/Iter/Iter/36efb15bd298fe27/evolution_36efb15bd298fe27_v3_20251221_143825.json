      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help analyze this malware trace to find an evasion bypass. The user provided the trace data from two different exit process calls. Both traces have similar steps but differ slightly at some points.\n\nFirst, looking at the first trace, it ends with call 0040E7C3h and then another call. The second trace is almost identical except for a slight change in an instruction before the final call. \n\nThe attacker probably wants to bypass sandbox detection by evading checks like E8C8FFFFFF, which might be checking if something is on the stack or a specific address.\n\nIn Phase 1, from the attacker's perspective, they implemented checks at certain points (like after push ebp) and exit when the call instruction isn't there. The evasion probably happens where these checks fail.\n\nLooking at the instructions:\n\nFor both traces, the key steps are:\n- mov edi, edi\n- push ebp\n- mov ebp, esp\n- push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n- E8C8FFFFFF (probably a check)\n- call 0040E7C3h\n\nThe difference is in trace #2 where after the call, they pop ecx and then push again. Maybe this adds context that bypasses some checks.\n\nIn Phase 2 for defenders, targets could be:\n1. E8C8FFFFFF: if it's a check before calling, skipping it would fail.\n2. The final call instruction: perhaps being modified or skipped.\n3. mov ebp, esp: maybe after pushing dword ptr, so skipping that might bypass the check.\n\nBuilding patterns based on Phase 4:\n\nFor each target, I need to create a 6-20 byte pattern with wildcards where applicable.\n\n1. Target E8C8FFFFFF: Maybe skip this instruction by having it as a wildcard.\nPattern could be something like {8B55?? ??} or similar, combining the surrounding instructions.\n\nWait, but looking at trace #2, after the call, they push again and pop ecx before calling again. So maybe skipping the E8C8FFFFFF would bypass one check.\n\nAnother approach: The attacker might have checks just before the calls in both traces. If we can target those calls to be skipped or modified.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the final call being made twice—maybe bypassing by manipulating something in between.\n\nWait, no—the exit process is called once per trace. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps the first call (E8C8FFFFFF) is a check for the stack. The second instruction after that pushes another dword ptr. So skipping the E8C8FFFFFF would avoid the check.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe looking at the context around each target:\n\n1. After push dword ptr, maybe there's a check before calling.\n2. The call itself might be checked for source code integrity or something else.\n3. The instruction after pop ecx—maybe that's where another check is done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the attacker used a two-step exit process and the second one was bypassed.\n\nWait, looking at both traces:\n\nIn trace #1:\n- E8C8FFFFFF call\n- then FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n- FF15ACB04100 call\n\nIn trace #2:\n- same steps except after the first call, they have 59 pop ecx and another FF7508 push.\n\nSo perhaps in trace #2, the attacker added an extra push which bypasses some checks. But not sure how that helps.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about multiple calls being made—maybe the exit process expects two steps but the first one was blocked by a check, so we need to bypass both.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on specific instructions:\n\nThe E8C8FFFFFF might be checking if the stack pointer (ESP) has a certain value after pushing. So perhaps in trace #2, they pushed again with different data, thus passing that check.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each call as an opportunity for bypass and create patterns around them.\n\nAlternatively, think about the flow: after pushing, then E8C8FFFFFF is checked, then a push. So if we skip E8C8FFFFFF, but in trace #2 they pop ecx before making another call—maybe that's where a check occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps each call has a different instruction following it. In trace #1, the next instruction after the first call is pushing, while in trace #2, it pops ecx and pushes again. So maybe the attacker added an extra step to bypass their own checks.\n\nBut how does this help us? Maybe we can target the E8C8FFFFFF instruction as a possible point of bypass by making its execution optional.\n\nSo for each pattern:\n\n1. Bypass the first call check (E8C8FFFFFF) in trace #1.\n2. Bypass the second call check after adding push in trace #2.\n3. Maybe another step like skipping the pop ecx or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on specific instructions where wildcards can be placed.\n\nLet me try constructing patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Around E8C8FFFFFF\n- Suppose this instruction is a check for some address. We can make it optional by surrounding it with context.\nSo maybe:\n8B55?? ?? (mov ebp, esp) followed by ?? ?? (push dword ptr), then skip the E8C8FFFFFF.\n\nWait, in trace #1: after mov ebp, esp comes push dword ptr, then call. So to bypass that check, we can make the E8C8FFFFFF instruction optional. But it's tricky because it's part of the same sequence.\n\nAlternatively, replace the instruction before or after with a wildcard.\n\nBut since the attacker uses this specific instruction as a check, perhaps in trace #1 they have E8C8FFFFFF call, so to bypass that, we can create a pattern where that instruction is skipped. So maybe:\n\n0040E7F6  ?? ?? (wildcards) followed by FF7508.\n\nBut need to include surrounding context.\n\nAlternatively, for each target instruction, I'll create a pattern that includes the surrounding instructions and makes the target instruction optional.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be: mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; skip E8C8FFFFFF (wildcard); then push dword ptr.\n\nPattern 1: Maybe skip the second call in trace #2 by making its check optional. Like after pop ecx, but before FF7508.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about what each instruction does and create patterns that bypass their checks.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for sequences where an instruction is followed or preceded by wildcards, indicating a possible skip.\n\nAnother approach: The attacker might have used specific offset checks. For example, in trace #2, after the first call, they pop ecx (59) and then push dword ptr again (FF7508). Maybe this adds a different offset that bypasses any previous address-based check.\n\nSo perhaps the second FF7508 is designed to pass a different test than the first one in trace #1. So by targeting that instruction, we can create a pattern where it's optional.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach: For each target instruction (call 0040E7C3h), check if they have any surrounding instructions that could be skipped or modified to bypass the checks before them.\n\nLooking at trace #1:\n\nAt 0040E7F6, E8C8FFFFFF is called. Maybe this instruction checks for something in the stack or a specific address. So if we can skip this call and still have execution continue, that would be a bypass.\n\nBut how? Since it's part of the same sequence as push dword ptr, perhaps by making the E8C8FFFFFF optional between mov ebp, esp and the push.\n\nAlternatively, combining multiple instructions into a pattern where one is skipped.\n\nWait, maybe in trace #1: After mov ebp, esp (0040E7F3), comes E8C8FFFFFF. If we skip that instruction by surrounding it with wildcards, like:\n\n8B55 ?? (mov ebp, esp) followed by ??. Then the next instruction is FF7508.\n\nSo a possible pattern could be: 8B55?? ?? FF7508\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of an example from the user's instructions on how to build patterns:\n\nGood Example: `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\nSo here, they have a series of instructions where some are wildcards.\n\nIn our case, perhaps each pattern should include the target instruction and surrounding context, with wildcards on address or offset bytes.\n\nLet me try to create Pattern 0:\n\nLooking at E8C8FFFFFF in trace #1. Maybe this instruction is a check for something after pushing. So if I can skip it by surrounding it with wildcards.\n\nSo maybe: mov edi, edi (0040E7EE), push ebp (0040E7F0), mov ebp, esp (0040E7F1), then skip E8C8FFFFFF and proceed to FF7508. So the pattern would be:\n\n0040E7EE 8B55 FF7508\n\nWait, but that's only three instructions. To make it 6-20 bytes, we need more context.\n\nIncluding surrounding instructions: mov edi, edi (0040E7EE), push ebp (0040E7F0), mov ebp, esp (0040E7F1), skip E8C8FFFFFF, then FF7508 and others. But this is getting messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instruction after E8C8FFFFFF can be modified to bypass any subsequent checks.\n\nWait, in trace #2, after the first call, they pop ecx (59) and push again (FF7508). Maybe that adds a different offset which bypasses some check. So perhaps targeting this FF7508 instruction as optional could create a bypass path.\n\nSo Pattern 1: include instructions leading up to FF7508 but make it optional with wildcards.\n\nAnother thought: The attacker might have inserted additional instructions in trace #2 (like pop ecx and another push) to avoid being detected. So the defender can model this by having wildcarded instructions that allow for such modifications.\n\nWait, maybe the best way is to focus on each call instruction as a possible target of bypass and create patterns around them with wildcards where applicable.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 0: Bypass E8C8FFFFFF in trace #1 by making it optional. So include the surrounding mov ebp, esp; push dword ptr; then skip E8C8FFFFFF and proceed to next instruction.\n\nPattern 1: In trace #2, after pop ecx (59), make the FF7508 optional so that any offset check is bypassed.\n\nPattern 2: Maybe target the final call in one of the traces by making its source or destination wildcard.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each pattern should include different steps from both traces to capture possible variations.\n</think>\n\nHere are three distinct patterns based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta: description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific instructions to bypass detection\"\n    cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings: {\n        $pattern0 = \"{8B55?? ??

The main issue is that the original patterns were too short—only 3 bytes each—and they needed to be expanded to between 6 and 20 bytes. \n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I see several instructions related to evasions like push and pop operations on the ebp register, followed by function calls.

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this Yara rule because it's not working correctly. The user provided some errors from the validation step. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the error messages: both $pattern1 and $pattern2 are too short. Each needs to be at least 6 bytes long but can't exceed 20 bytes. The current patterns are only 3 and 4 bytes respectively, which is way below the required length.\n\nThe original rule has three patterns named $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2. But according to the error analysis, there's a problem with the pattern count too. Wait, no—the error says \"Pattern Count Issue,\" but in this case, it seems like each individual pattern is too short, not that the number of patterns is wrong.\n\nSo, I need to make sure each pattern is between 6 and 20 bytes. Also, from the trace data provided, the evasive checks are at specific points: $pattern1 is at 0040E7F0 (push ebp) and $pattern2 at 0040E7F1 (mov ebp, esp). \n\nI should combine these instructions with surrounding context to make each pattern longer. For example, including the instruction before push ebp or the one after mov ebp, along with some wildcard bytes for addresses.\n\nLet me break down how to construct each pattern:\n\nFor $pattern0: It's probably a different check in the trace. Looking at the trace data, maybe around 0040E7EE (mov edi, edi). So I can include that instruction and a few following ones with wildcards.\n\n$pattern1 is push ebp at 5 bytes. To make it longer, I'll add more instructions after it, like pushing some values or moving registers, replacing any address bytes with ??.\n\nSimilarly, $pattern2 is mov ebp, esp at 6 bytes. Again, adding surrounding context to reach the required length.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern uses wildcards for all address/offset bytes and keeps opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nLet me draft some patterns:\n\n$pattern0: Maybe include the mov edi, edi (5 bytes) plus a few more instructions. Like mov edi, edi 8B45, then push ebp E7F0, so the pattern could be 8B45 55 push ebp... but wait, that's too short.\n\nWait, maybe starting from E8C8FFFFFF which is in the strings section. But no, I should use instructions from the trace. Let me think: Looking at the trace, after mov edi, edi (0040E7EE), then 55 push ebp (0040E7F0). So maybe $pattern0 can include these two instructions plus some context.\n\nWait, but according to the original strings section:\n\n$pattern0 = { 8B45FC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n\nThat's three hex bytes? Or is each byte separated by colons?\n\nActually, in Yara patterns, it's spaces between bytes. So maybe I need to represent each instruction as its hex components.\n\nWait no, the current $pattern0 is 3 bytes: 8B45FC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF? Wait, that can't be right because each instruction is multiple bytes.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of assembly instructions and their corresponding bytes. For example, mov edi, edi is 8B45 in hex (assuming 32-bit), push ebp is 55, etc.\n\nBut the original rule had $pattern0 as a single instruction with multiple bytes, which might be causing issues. Instead, I should combine consecutive instructions into each pattern to reach the required length.\n\nSo for $pattern0: Let's take mov edi, edi (8B45) followed by push ebp (55), and then maybe another instruction like 8BEC (mov ebp, esp). So combining these three would give us a longer pattern. But wait, each instruction is more than one byte.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each instruction in hex can be multiple bytes depending on the CPU's word size, but Yara treats them as individual bytes for matching purposes unless specified otherwise with wildcards. However, to make it specific enough, combining consecutive instructions would create a longer pattern that matches only at the intended location.\n\nSo maybe $pattern0 should include push ebp and some context after it. Let me see: Push ebp is E7F0 (if using a 16-bit address), but in the trace, it's part of E8C8FFFFFF which is a 32-byte displacement. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that.\n\nWait, maybe $pattern0 can be something like push ebp followed by some wildcards for the offset and then another instruction. For example: 55 (push ebp) + ?? (displacement) + E8C8FFFFFF. But wait, E8 is a call instruction with an offset of C8FFFFFF.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to represent each part as hex bytes:\n\nE7F0 is push ebp if it's a 16-bit address, but in this case, the trace shows that after push ebp (55), there are more instructions. So maybe $pattern0 should include those following instructions.\n\nAlternatively, let me think differently: Each pattern must be at least 6 bytes long. Let's see:\n\nFor $pattern0: Maybe E7F0 is push ebp (assuming it's a 16-bit address). If I need to make it longer, perhaps add the next few bytes after that instruction which are part of the trace.\n\nLooking at the trace data for each sample:\n\nIn TRACE #1:\n- After 55 (push ebp) comes 8BEC (mov ebp, esp), then FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]), etc.\n\nSo perhaps $pattern0 can be E7F0 followed by some context. But I'm not sure how to make it fit into 6 bytes with wildcards.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to take each instruction from the trace and include them in a longer pattern.\n\nLet me try constructing:\n\n$pattern0 = { 55 (push ebp) ?? (displacement) E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) }\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps take push ebp (E7F0), then include some bytes after it.\n\nWait, let me correct myself: Push ebp is the instruction at address 0x55 in the trace, which is E7F0 as a hex byte? Wait no, E7F0 is another instruction. Maybe I'm confusing the addresses with the bytes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should be built by combining multiple instructions into their respective hex bytes and adding wildcards where necessary.\n\nFor example:\n\n$pattern0 could be 55 (push ebp) followed by some context, like moving a value or another instruction.\n\nWait, looking at the original strings section, $pattern1 is push ebp (E7F0). So maybe I can use that as part of pattern1 but make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should consist of three consecutive instructions with wildcards on any address/offset bytes.\n\nLet me try to create:\n\n$pattern0: mov edi, edi (8B45) + push ebp (E7F0?) Wait no, E7F0 is another instruction. Maybe it's better to take the first few relevant instructions and combine them into a longer pattern.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because in the trace data, each line starts with the address followed by the hex instruction. So for example:\n\n0x55: push ebp (hex 0xE7F0)\n0x60: 8B EC (mov ebp, esp)\n\nSo maybe $pattern1 is at 0x55 and includes that instruction plus some context after it.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to structure this. Maybe each pattern should consist of multiple consecutive instructions combined into a single pattern string with enough bytes to meet the minimum length.\n\nLet me try constructing:\n\n$pattern0: Starting from mov edi, edi (8B45) followed by push ebp (E7F0). So 8B45 E7F0. That's two instructions, each being multiple bytes in hex. To make it a single pattern string with enough bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take the first instruction and then some context after that. For example:\n\n$pattern0: push ebp (E7F0) followed by 83 C4 (pop eax) plus ?? for any displacement or offset, making it E7F0 83C4 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact hex values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern is built from a single instruction and some surrounding context. But since each individual instruction is longer than 6 bytes, combining them with wildcards would help reach the required length.\n\nI think the key is to include multiple instructions in each pattern, using wildcards for any address or displacement bytes that are not known.\n\nSo let me try constructing:\n\n$pattern0: push ebp (E7F0) followed by some context. Maybe a few more instructions after it with wildcards.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about the exact hex representation of these instructions. Let's break down each instruction into its corresponding hex value and see how to combine them.\n\nFor example, 55 is push ebp, which in hex is 0xE7F0 (assuming it's a 16-bit address). So $pattern1 can be E7F0 followed by some context, but that alone is only two bytes. To make it at least six bytes, I need to add more instructions.\n\nPerhaps after push ebp, the next instruction is mov ebp, esp (8B EC), which in hex would be 0x55 and then 0x08EC? Wait no, 8B EC is another instruction. Hmm, maybe each instruction's hex representation varies based on addressing mode.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of each pattern as including the relevant assembly instructions plus some wildcard bytes for unknown offsets or displacements.\n\nLet me try:\n\n$pattern0: mov edi, edi (8B45) followed by push ebp (E7F0), then some context like 83 C4 (pop eax). So combining these would give a longer pattern. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because each instruction is multiple bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to take the relevant instructions and include their hex representations with wildcards for any unknown bytes beyond them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use placeholder patterns like push ebp followed by some displacement and another instruction, using ?? where offsets are unknown.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the example provided in the validation response:\n\nFor a call instruction: E8 + 4 offset bytes becomes E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nSo perhaps each pattern should include multiple consecutive instructions, with wildcards for any displacement or unknown bytes after them.\n\nTherefore, let's try constructing three patterns as follows:\n\n$pattern0: push ebp (E7F0) followed by some context. Let's say E7F0 55 83 C4 ?? ?? ?? ????\n\nWait, no, because each instruction is separate. Alternatively, perhaps $pattern0 includes the mov edi, edi and then the push ebp:\n\n$pattern0: 8B45 (mov edi, edi) followed by E7F0 (push ebp). But that's two instructions; to make it a single pattern string with enough bytes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pattern is built as follows: take an instruction, add some following instructions with wildcards for any displacement or unknown offsets.\n\nWait, perhaps the simplest way is to use placeholder patterns where each includes multiple consecutive instructions and uses ?? for any displacement or offset. This would make each pattern longer than 6 bytes.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n$pattern0: E7F0 (push ebp) followed by some context like moving a register with 8B EC, then pushing another value, etc., but using wildcards where necessary to reach the required length.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to take three consecutive instructions from the trace and include them in each pattern, using ?? for any unknown parts beyond that.\n\nAlternatively, since I can't see the exact hex representations of these instructions beyond their names, perhaps each pattern is constructed by taking a few relevant instructions and replacing known bytes with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI think I need to create three patterns:\n\n$pattern0: push ebp (E7F0) followed by some context. Let's say E7F0 83 C4 ?? ??\n\nBut that might not be enough. Maybe include more instructions after push ebp, like mov ebp, esp, then some displacement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps $pattern0 can be something like:\n\n$pattern0 = {55 (push ebp) ?? (displacement of ebp+...) E8C8FFFFFF }\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to represent that in hex. Maybe each instruction is a separate byte with wildcards for unknown bytes beyond them.\n\nI think the key is to combine consecutive instructions into each pattern and use wildcards where displacement or offset bytes are known or unknown.\n\nAfter struggling a bit, here's an attempt:\n\n$pattern0: mov edi, edi (8B45) followed by push ebp (E7F0), then some context like 83 C4 (pop eax). So the pattern would be 8B45 E7F0 83C4. That's four bytes so far; need more to reach at least six.\n\nWait, but each instruction is multiple bytes in hex, so combining them might not work as intended. Alternatively, perhaps each pattern should include a few instructions with wildcards for any unknown parts beyond them.\n\nIn the end, I think the best way is to construct each pattern by taking relevant consecutive instructions and adding enough wildcards to meet the minimum length of six bytes.\n</think>\n\nTo fix the Yara rule, we need to ensure each pattern is at least 6 bytes long with the correct number of patterns. Each pattern should include relevant assembly instructions and use wildcards for unknown displacement or offset bytes.\n\nHere's the corrected Yara rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 E7F0 83C4 ?? ?? ?? }  # push ebp followed by context\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFFFF 8BEC 83C4 ?? ?? ?? }  # call dword ptr [ebp+08h] and mov ebp, esp\n        $pattern2 = { 6A EC 55 E7F0 83C4 ?? ?? ?? }  # example pattern for third check\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThis rule now includes three patterns each meeting the required length by combining relevant instructions with wildcards.",
