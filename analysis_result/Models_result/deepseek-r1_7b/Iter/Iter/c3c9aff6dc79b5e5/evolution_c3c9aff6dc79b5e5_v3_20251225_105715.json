      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this malware's evasion tactics based on the provided trace data. The goal is to figure out where the attacker might have inserted bypasses and then create Yara rules to detect them.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace, it seems like there are multiple calls and jumps happening around certain points. I notice that at line 004138DD, there's a call instruction: FF1538414100. This is followed by some other instructions until the exitProcess happens.\n\nI think one potential bypass could be after this call. Maybe the attacker is trying to skip over some checks after calling this function. So perhaps between 004138DD and 004138EB, there's a point where if skipped, it would bypass some sandbox detection.\n\nNext, at line 004138F5, there's an A3C8B04100 instruction. This seems like part of moving data from somewhere to EAX. If this step is skipped, maybe the test after that (at 00413902) wouldn't find anything because the value in EAX hasn't been set properly.\n\nThen, looking at line 004138F5 again, there's a mov instruction: A3C8B04100. If this is skipped, perhaps it would prevent the test at 00413902 from being triggered because EAX wouldn't have been modified as expected.\n\nSo I'm thinking of creating three patterns based on these points:\n\n1. Skipping after FF1538414100\n2. Skipping A3C8B04100\n3. Skipping the mov instruction at F5\n\nEach pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes, include the target instruction and surrounding context with wildcards where appropriate.\n\nFor the first bypass, after FF1538414100, maybe we can capture the next few instructions until the jump happens. So between DD (call) and EB (jmp), which is a jump to 38DD. Maybe capturing from DD+2 onward.\n\nThe second pattern could be around the A3C8B04100 instruction at F5. If it's skipped, perhaps the next instruction after that (F7: FF35D4B0) would cause issues because EAX wasn't set correctly.\n\nThird, maybe skipping the F5 mov entirely and capturing until some other instruction. Alternatively, if we skip from F5 to F6, which is a push, then capture around there.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern uses wildcards for addresses or offsets and keeps opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n</think>\n\nHere are three Yara rules based on the identified bypass points:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 004138DD FF1538414100 6A00 FF75F8 6A00 FF75FC 6A00 FF35D4B0 4100 FF15D044 4100 EB 38 DD }\n        $pattern1 = { 004138F5 A3C8B04100 ?? ?? ?? ?? 6A02 FF1528444100 6A00 FF1570444100 7410 }\n        $pattern2 = { 004138F5 A3C8B04100 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help create a better Yara bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. The goal is to find an improved pattern that can successfully bypass the malware checks.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, there are multiple calls happening before the exit process. Strategy A suggests checking for a call followed by a test of EAX with JE or JNE. From the trace, I see lines like 00413860 FF75D4444100 which is a call, then 00413869 FF1598444100 another call, and so on.\n\nBut in the first attempt, YARA didn't match because the pattern was too broad. So maybe I need to be more specific with the addresses or instructions. Let me check where each call is followed by a test of EAX.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- Line 00413860: FF75D4444100 (call dword ptr...)\n- Next line 00413869: FF1598444100 (another call)\nBut these are different calls, so maybe I'm not looking in the right place.\n\nWait, perhaps each call is followed by a test EAX. Let me scan through:\n\nAfter FF75D4444100 (line 6), we have FF1598444100 at line 9, which is a different instruction—call dword ptr [00414498h]. So maybe that's not the EAX test.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nLine 004138C8: 837D1000 is cmp dword ptr [ebp+10h], 00000000h. That's a comparison, but not necessarily an EAX test.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing the right sequence. Another approach could be to look for specific instruction sequences that bypass the exit process, like conditional jumps or delays.\n\nWait, in Strategy B, it suggests looking before the exit call. The trace has lines like 004138DD FF1538414100 which is a call at line 67 (assuming each line increments by one). Before that, perhaps there's an instruction sequence that bypasses it.\n\nLooking back earlier in the trace:\n\nLine 004138D5: FF1528444100 is another call. Maybe after that? Or maybe looking for a conditional before the exit.\n\nWait, line 004138C0 has push eax and then A3C8B04100 which moves EAX into a register. Then FF1548444100 at line FA is another call.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after these calls, there's a conditional that can be bypassed.\n\nBut the key point from the feedback was that the pattern matched but didn't hit the signatures—so it was matching too broadly or in the wrong place. So perhaps I need to make the patterns more specific by using exact addresses or operations.\n\nLet me think about how Yara works: it looks for exact hex matches. If I use wildcards, it might match unintended places because those bytes could appear elsewhere in memory.\n\nSo, maybe instead of matching all 64 bits (0x12345678), I should only match specific instructions with known patterns from the trace and use wildcards on varying parts like addresses or offsets.\n\nLooking at Strategy C: using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID. But those might be more complex to model in Yara rules without knowing exact conditions.\n\nAlternatively, focusing back on Strategy A—maybe the bypass is happening earlier than I thought. For example, after certain calls followed by specific instructions that trigger EAX tests and conditionals.\n\nWait, line 00413869 is FF1598444100 (call dword ptr [00414498h])—so perhaps the next instruction is a test EAX. Let me check:\n\nAfter that call, at line 0041387C: push 00000000h.\n\nThen FF75FC and FF75F8 pushes. Then at line 0041389A: je 004138ACh—so after a series of calls, we have a jump to another address.\n\nWait, maybe the bypass is happening before that. Perhaps an instruction sequence where EAX is tested and then a conditional jump is made based on that result.\n\nAnother angle: the exit process at line 00413900 (33C0 xor eax, eax; C9 leave; C21000 retn 0x0h). So before that, perhaps there's an instruction that bypasses this return point.\n\nLooking earlier in the trace:\n\nLine 004138DD: FF1538414100 is a call to [00414138h]. Maybe after this, some manipulation of EAX happens.\n\nWait, line 004138E5: FF158C444100 (call dword ptr [0041448Ch]). So perhaps the exit is being bypassed by a conditional jump before that call?\n\nAlternatively, maybe after certain operations on EAX, like moving it into another register.\n\nWait, line 004138D2: 6A09 push 0x09h. Then FF1548444100 (call dword ptr [00414448h]) at line FA.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on finding specific instruction sequences that are known to bypass the exit process.\n\nAlternatively, since the previous Yara rule didn't match, perhaps using exact patterns with wildcards where applicable would help reduce false positives.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Pattern 1: A call followed by a test EAX (like FF75D4444100 followed by FF1598444100 and then maybe some manipulation of EAX)\nBut I'm not sure if that's specific enough.\n\nWait, another thought—maybe after certain calls, the code is testing EAX with a known offset. For example:\n\nAt line 00413860: FF75D4444100 (call dword ptr...)\nLine 00413869: FF1598444100 (another call)\nBut these are different calls, so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a call to a specific address followed by EAX testing. For example:\n\nAt line 004138D5: FF1528444100 is a call to [00414428h]. Then at some point after that, perhaps an EAX test.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bypass involves pushing values into EAX and then jumping based on conditions involving EAX.\n\nWait, line 004138D5: FF1528444100 (call dword ptr [00414428h]) followed by some pushes. Maybe after that, the code is testing EAX with a specific value and then conditionally jumping.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what comes next, it's hard to create precise patterns.\n\nAnother approach: look for conditional jumps or delays before the exit point. For example, if there's a jump like jmp 00413900h (the return address), maybe bypassing that with a different instruction sequence.\n\nLooking at line 004138E5: FF158C444100 is a call to [0041448Ch]. Before that, perhaps some manipulation of EAX or other registers which can be bypassed.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the earlier lines where the function calls are made. Maybe after certain calls, there's an instruction like push eax followed by a mov instruction with specific bytes.\n\nWait, line 004138D2: 6A09 is pushing 0x09h. Then at 004138D5, FF1528... call. Maybe after that, some manipulation of EAX or other registers which can be bypassed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bypass involves a series of pushes and pops to simulate stack frames, making it harder for the exit process to detect.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what's happening in between, it's challenging. Maybe I should focus on specific instruction sequences that are known to cause bypasses, such as using conditional jumps or delays with specific offsets.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1: A call followed by a conditional jump based on EAX value. So FFxxx...call..., then jmp if EAX is zero.\n\nBut without knowing the exact offset of EAX at that point, it's hard to create an exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after certain calls, there's a test like cmp eax, 0x12345678 followed by jne. If I can find where this occurs and use specific values with wildcards for the unknown parts, it might work.\n\nAnother idea: look at the initial trace steps that are being called before exiting. Maybe the exit is being triggered after certain data has been moved into registers or the stack.\n\nWait, line 004138A5: FF35D4B04100 (push dword ptr [0041B0D8h]) and then another push at 004138A4. Maybe these are pushing data that is causing the exit to be triggered unless bypassed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after pushing some data, the code is testing EAX with a specific value, like 0x12345678h.\n\nIf I can find where in the trace an instruction uses EAX and has a known or specific offset, that could help create a pattern.\n\nWait, at line 004138C8: 837D1000 is cmp dword ptr [ebp+10h], 00000000h. That's comparing an unknown value to zero. If the code after this does something based on that comparison, maybe we can create a bypass around it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- After line C8: compare EBP+10 with 0x0.\n- Then perhaps conditionally jump or move data based on that.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what comes next, it's tricky. Maybe I should focus on more concrete instruction sequences where specific bytes are known and use wildcards for the unknown parts.\n\nAlternatively, considering the failure reason was \"YARA pattern did not match\"—meaning Yara didn't find any matching patterns despite previous attempts. So maybe my initial patterns were too broad or didn't align with the actual code path being taken now.\n\nPerhaps I should look at recent changes in the trace and see if there are specific instructions that have appeared after some calls which can be targeted for bypass.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- Line 004138C5: FF15D7FC is pushing a word into [ebp+08h], then line C6 FF35F3... push dword ptr [ebp-04h]. So these are two consecutive pushes. Maybe after that, there's an instruction like cmp eax, 0x12345678 which would be specific.\n\nIf I can find where in the trace such a comparison occurs with a known offset, then create a pattern targeting that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's too risky to guess exact offsets without more information. So perhaps using more generic patterns, like comparing EBP+something or EAX with something.\n\nBut since Yara uses exact hex matches, I have to be precise where possible.\n\nAnother approach: look for specific instruction sequences known to bypass exit processes, such as adding a delay after certain instructions or using conditional jumps that skip the return address.\n\nWait, in Strategy B, it's about checking before the exit. So maybe there's an instruction like cmp ... jne before the exit call. If I can find where that is and create a pattern targeting that, then Yara would know to bypass it.\n\nAlternatively, if after certain calls, EAX is tested with a known offset and conditionally jumped based on that, creating a pattern for that could help.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what those instructions are, it's hard. Maybe I should focus on the earlier parts where the function makes multiple calls—perhaps one of those has a bypassable instruction sequence after some pushes or pops.\n\nWait, at line 004138A5: FF35D4B04100 is pushing dword ptr [0041B0D8h], then another push at A4. Maybe these are setting up stack frames that the exit process relies on, so bypassing them would require simulating the stack.\n\nBut without knowing how to simulate it with Yara rules, this might be too vague.\n\nAnother idea: maybe after certain function calls, the code is testing EAX and then conditionally jumping based on its value. If I can find where in the trace such a jump occurs with specific conditions, I can create a pattern for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an instruction like mov eax, [some address] followed by a conditional jump if eax equals some value. If I can find those sequences and use wildcards where needed, it might help.\n\nBut this seems too vague without more context from the trace.\n\nWait, going back to Strategy C: using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID. Maybe the bypass involves getting the current time or processor ID which could be used for a unique signature that the exit process doesn't expect.\n\nBut implementing such techniques in Yara would require specific instructions and may not fit well with the existing rules, especially if they're too slow or use varying addresses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a delay instruction to create enough time for the bypass without relying on EAX testing. For example, adding a series of delays after certain calls so that the exit process doesn't detect it quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this in Yara as I don't have specific examples from the trace.\n\nPerhaps another angle: looking at the stack operations before the exit. Maybe the code is pushing too many values onto the stack, and bypassing that by manipulating the stack with push/pop instructions that mask or simulate the correct state.\n\nBut again, without knowing exact sequences, it's hard to create precise patterns.\n\nWait, maybe after a series of pushes (like at lines 004138A5, A4, etc.), there's an instruction like xor eax, some_value. If I can find where that happens and use specific values with wildcards for unknown parts, it might help.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the early part of the trace: maybe after a call at line 6 (FF75D4444100), there's an instruction like push eax followed by a mov. If I can find that sequence and use specific addresses with wildcards, it could work.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what comes next, this is speculative.\n\nPerhaps to simplify, let's focus on creating patterns that are known to bypass exit processes—like conditional jumps or delays based on EAX values—and use the exact instructions from the trace where possible, using wildcards for varying parts.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1: After a call (like FF75D4444100), there's an instruction like cmp eax, [something] followed by jne. So create a pattern with FFxxx...call..., then some instruction that matches the known comparison and jump sequence.\n\nBut without knowing the exact offset or next instructions, it's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after certain function calls (like FF15D4B04100), there's an instruction like push eax followed by a conditional move based on EAX. If I can find where that happens in the trace and use specific addresses with wildcards, it might match better.\n\nBut again, without exact knowledge, this is challenging.\n\nPerhaps the best approach now is to take existing Yara bypass rules from similar malware analysis and adapt them to fit the current trace, using patterns found within the given instruction sequence.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The initial attempt didn't find matching signatures because the pattern matched too broadly or in the wrong location.

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and feedback. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the current best rule didn't match any new signatures, which means it's either matching in the wrong place or not specific enough. The previous attempts tried strategies A (evolution check) and B (exit decision), but both failed because the YARA pattern didn't match at those points.\n\nLooking at the trace provided, I see a lot of call instructions followed by je/jne. For example, line 00413860 is FF75D4444100 which is a call instruction with an offset. Then it's followed by a series of pushes and jumps.\n\nStrategy A involves looking for a test+je/mov in the first 30% of the trace, but since our rule already tried that without success, maybe we need to adjust where we're checking or add more specific conditions.\n\nStrategy B is about finding conditional checks before the exit. In this case, the exit process seems to be at FF1538414100 (call dword ptr [00414138h]), but perhaps there's a condition before that which we can exploit.\n\nThe original trace analysis shows multiple calls and jumps. For instance, after line 00413860, there are several pushes and then the call to 004144D4h. Maybe if I look for specific instruction sequences right before these calls or after a certain number of pushes.\n\nOne approach could be to find a pattern where multiple pushes occur (like three push eax) followed by a conditional jump like je/jnp, which might indicate an early exit condition that we can bypass.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- At 00413860: FF75D4444100 (call with offset)\n- Then multiple pushes (like FF7508 twice) and then another call.\n  \nPerhaps if I find a pattern where after pushing three times, there's a je/jnp before the actual exit call. That might indicate an early return condition.\n\nAnother thought is to look for specific addresses or operations that are unique in this trace. For example, addresses like 0x41B0C8h or 0x415EC0h seem to be used frequently. Maybe using these as a basis for the bypass pattern would help.\n\nI should also consider the instruction sequences after each call. After some calls, there are jmps (like EB38) that lead to 00413900h, which is likely an exit point. So if I can find a way to bypass these conditional jumps more reliably, it might work.\n\nNow, let's try constructing three specific patterns based on this analysis:\n\n1. **Pattern A**: After pushing three times, check for a je/jne before the call. This could target an early return condition.\n2. **Pattern B**: Look for a specific sequence of pushes and then conditional jumps to bypass an exit path.\n3. **Pattern C**: Use known addresses or operations (like 0x41B0C8h) in the trace as part of the pattern.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses exact hex values from the trace, and includes wildcards for varying offsets where applicable. Each pattern should be distinct to avoid false matches.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these patterns into a YARA rule with appropriate meta descriptions and conditions.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The current bypass attempts failed because they didn't match specific instruction sequences in the correct locations. By focusing on unique instruction patterns after multiple pushes followed by conditional jumps or known addresses, we can create more precise bypass conditions.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK, CMP_SETZ, RDTSC timing\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target specific sequences in the trace where early returns or unique addresses could be exploited for a bypass. By focusing on these predictable instruction flows, we increase the likelihood of successful bypass without matching incorrect locations.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - focuses on specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 00413860 FF75D4444100 ??00 ??00 ??00 7532 jne 00413900h }\n        $pattern1 = { 004138A4 FF1590444100 ??00 ??00 ??00 FF35D4B04100 jmp 00413900h }\n        $pattern2 = { 004138E5 FF158C444100 ??00 ??00 ??00 6A09 push 0041B0C8h }\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
