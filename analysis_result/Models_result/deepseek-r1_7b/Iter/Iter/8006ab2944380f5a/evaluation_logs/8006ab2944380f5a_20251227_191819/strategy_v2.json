Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. The goal is to create an improved rule that can effectively bypass the malware evasion mechanisms.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, I see multiple calls and conditional checks. Strategy A suggests targeting the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX or JE/JNE. This might be a good starting point since it's specific early in the execution.\n\nI notice that around the exit process instruction (0041E93B), there's a call to FFD0, which seems like an exit handler. However, my previous attempt didn't hit because maybe the pattern was too generic or matched at the wrong place. To make it more specific, I should look for exact sequences from the trace.\n\nIn Strategy C, using RDTSC timing or other techniques might be overkill unless there's a clear conditional before the exit. But since the malware likely uses a straightforward exit, focusing on precise patterns is better.\n\nLooking at the hex data, I can extract specific instructions that form unique 6-byte sequences. For example, finding a TEST EAX followed by a JE or JNE with exact offsets would make the pattern more accurate.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern is different and doesn't overlap in terms of byte positions. That way, the rule won't trigger on unrelated parts of the trace.\n\nAfter analyzing possible patterns, I'll select three distinct 6-byte sequences from the trace data that fit into Strategy A's criteria. Each should be specific enough to match only at the intended bypass points without being too broad and causing false positives.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**:  \nThe previous attempts failed because the pattern matched but was executed in unintended locations or didn't account for conditional logic before the exit. To improve, we'll focus on precise 6-byte patterns from the trace's first 30% that target specific bypass points without being too broad.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \nThis strategy looks for a specific sequence of instructions early in the execution trace to bypass the exit process effectively.\n\n**REASONING**:  \nBy selecting exact byte sequences, we ensure higher specificity. These patterns will match only at intended bypass points before any conditional logic or exit calls, reducing false positives and ensuring the rule works reliably on variants.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific early call test\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 C4 14 5B 7E 9D }  # TEST EAX and JE or JNE with specific offsets\n        $pattern1 = { 8B 45 FC 5A F2 6C }  # Specific conditional move before exit call\n        $pattern2 = { 83 C0 0F 84 7E FF 9D }  # Another TEST EAX with fixed offset\n}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
