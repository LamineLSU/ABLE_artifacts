        "prompt_tokens": 3240,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct the YARA rule for the evasion bypass based on the provided traces. The original rule was missing some parts and had issues with address bytes not being wildcards. Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the valid YARA structure, it requires a meta section with description, cape_options, and condition. The strings are $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2, each 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for addresses or offsets.\n\nThe original rule had three patterns but didn't include the correct wildcard usage and was missing the cape_options. So my task is to create three distinct patterns from the given traces, apply wildcards where needed, add the necessary opcode and register bytes without hardcoding addresses, and structure everything correctly.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can see that each pattern corresponds to a different call instruction in the code. For example:\n\n- $pattern0 seems to be around the first few instructions of the traces.\n- $pattern1 is after another set of instructions before the call.\n- $pattern2 is after yet another set and then the call.\n\nEach time, there's an 85C0 (test eax), a 74xx (conditional jump), followed by some pushes or pops, then an 8B?? (mov to ebp or similar). So each of these can form a pattern where I capture the necessary instructions before the call and apply wildcards.\n\nI need to ensure that all address bytes are replaced with ??, keep opcodes and registers concrete. Also, combine multiple instructions into one pattern for length requirements. Let me draft each pattern:\n\n1. For $pattern0: It seems to be 85C0 (test eax), then a conditional jump like 7412 (je 0F8400h?), followed by some pushes and pops, then an 8BCE (mov ecx, esi) before the call. So I can capture these instructions with wildcards where necessary.\n\nWait, let me check the trace again. In each case, after test eax comes a conditional jump, then some stack operations, then mov to register, then call. So for each pattern:\n\n- Pattern0: 85C0 (test eax), 7412 (je 0F8433FDFFFF?), and the 8BCE before E825050000.\n\nBut I need to make sure that in each pattern, after the target instruction's offset bytes are replaced with ??.\n\nAlso, considering the wildcards: for example, any displacement or address should be replaced. So in 8B?? it would become 8B??. \n\nI think I can create three patterns by combining these sequences:\n\nPattern0: 85 C0 (test eax), then a conditional jump like 74 12 followed by pushes and pops, then an 8B CE mov, then the call.\n\nWait, but in the first trace, after test eax comes 7412, which is je 0F8433FDFFFF. Then some pushes, E825050000 (call). So pattern0 would include these steps.\n\nSimilarly for other traces with different jumps like 6A5B and BA21050001.\n\nI think each of the three patterns can be formed by taking a segment that includes test eax, conditional jump to offset some code, stack operations, then mov to register, and call.\n\nSo I'll create:\n\n$pattern0: 85C0 (test eax) + 74?? as conditional jump, followed by pushes/pops, then 8BCE or similar, and the call.\n\nWait, but each trace has a different sequence. Let me check each:\n\nTRACE #1:\n- After test eax is 6A5B push, then E825050000 (call). So the call comes after the push.\n\nTRACE #2:\n- Similar to TRACE #1.\n\nTRACE #3 and #4: Different because they have a different initial instruction. Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in TRACE #3 and #4, the first few instructions are 8BFF (mov edi), then push ebp, mov ebp, push dword ptr, call E7C3h. So these don't include test eax.\n\nHmm, this complicates things because the original rule's patterns included a test eax instruction which isn't present in all traces.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my approach. The original YARA rule had three patterns with test eax but looking at the traces, not all of them have that sequence.\n\nIn the given traces:\n\n- TRaces #1 and 2 have 85C0 (test eax)\n- Traces #3 and 4 don't have 8BFF or similar, so perhaps they are using a different bypass method.\n\nBut since the original rule was designed for these evasions, maybe all three patterns should be based on test eax jumps leading to calls. Or perhaps each trace is using a different instruction as bypass.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the previous YARA rule had 3 patterns but failed validation because of missing parts and address wildcards. So I need to create three distinct patterns from the traces given, ensuring they are specific enough (6-20 bytes) with correct wildcards.\n\nLooking at the given trace data:\n\n- The first two traces have 85C0 (test eax), then a conditional jump like 7412, followed by stack operations and calls.\n- The third and fourth traces start differently, so maybe they are using a different bypass method, perhaps based on mov instruction.\n\nWait, in the given rule, the original patterns were:\n\n$pattern0 = {85C0...}\n$pattern1 = {BA21...)\n$pattern2 = {FF75...}\n\nBut I need to adjust them with wildcards and ensure they are correct.\n\nLet me try creating three patterns based on the first two traces (since the third and fourth don't have 85C0, but maybe I can find a pattern there).\n\nWait, maybe each pattern corresponds to a different way of bypassing, such as using a conditional jump before the call with varying instructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the third and fourth traces, they are using mov instructions. For example:\n\nIn TRACE #3:\n- 8BFF (mov edi), push ebp, mov ebp, push dword ptr, then E7C3h (call).\n\nSo to create a pattern around this, it would be:\n\n8B FF (mov edi), push ebp, mov ebp, push ???, call E7C3h.\n\nSimilarly for the fourth trace, which is almost identical except with different instruction names but same call.\n\nBut since the original rule had three patterns, perhaps each corresponds to one of these bypass methods.\n\nSo I can create:\n\n$pattern0: Based on 85C0 + conditional jump before call\n$pattern1: Another variation from the first two traces (maybe a different conditional)\n$pattern2: From the third and fourth traces using mov instructions\n\nBut since the user's original rule included these three, perhaps I need to adjust them with wildcards.\n\nLet me try drafting each pattern:\n\nFor $pattern0:\n- 85C0 (test eax) + 7412 (je 0F8433FDFFFF) or similar.\nSo: {85 C0 74 ?? ...}\n\nBut I need to include the necessary steps before call.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to capture each unique path leading to the call. So for the first two traces:\n\nEach has:\n- test eax\n- conditional jump (74??) with specific offset bytes\n- some stack manipulation (pushes/pops)\n- then mov instruction followed by call\n\nSo maybe $pattern0 captures this.\n\nFor the third and fourth traces, they use a different path starting with 8BFF/mov, push ebp, etc., leading to E7C3h. So I can create another pattern based on that.\n\nI think creating three patterns is feasible: two from the first two traces (similar but unique) and one from the third/fourth.\n\nBut since each trace uses a different initial instruction, perhaps all three patterns should be included.\n\nSo here's how I can structure them:\n\n$pattern0:\n85C0 7412 ... leading to call\n\n$pattern1:\n6A5B (push) + E825050000 (call)\n\n$pattern2:\n8BFF (mov edi), push ebp, mov ebp, push dword ptr, E7C3h\n\nBut I need to make sure that each pattern is 6-20 bytes and includes the necessary opcodes with wildcards where needed.\n\nAlso, ensure that in each case, any address or offset is replaced with ??.\n\nFor example:\n\n$pattern0 = {85 C0 74 12 ...}\nBut wait, in the first trace, after test eax (85C0) comes 7412. So maybe pattern0 includes these steps.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think I need to carefully map each instruction into a pattern that's 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions as needed with wildcards.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the original rule had three patterns but their meta section was missing. So in the corrected version, I need to include the cape_options correctly.\n\nPutting it all together, here are my final patterns:\n\n$pattern0: Combines 85C0 (test eax), then a conditional jump with specific offset bytes, followed by some stack operations and call.\n$pattern1: Uses 6A5B push before the call.\n$pattern2: Uses mov edi, then push ebp, etc., leading to E7C3h.\n\nEach pattern is constructed with wildcards for address/offsets and includes enough opcodes to be specific without hardcoding addresses.\n\nI think this should satisfy all the requirements: 3 patterns, each 6-20 bytes, correct use of wildcards, and the necessary metadata in meta section.\n</think>\n\nTo address the YARA validation errors, we need to ensure that each pattern is correctly structured with wildcards for address/offsets, includes the correct opcodes without hardcoding, and follows the required format. Here's the corrected rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 7412 E8CE ?? ?? ?? ??

Let me see what's wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at the original rule, the meta section is missing the description and the cape_options. The strings section has three different patterns, but wait\u2014no, there are only two in the provided code. Oh right, I think the user had three patterns but maybe they didn't list them correctly here or perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nThe validation error says \"Missing basic YARA rule structure (rule name, strings, condition)\". So, the rule is missing some required parts like the description and the meta section properly. Also, each pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long, all address/offsets must use wildcards, and there should be exactly three patterns.\n\nLooking at the original code, I see two patterns but three are expected. So probably, in the actual data, there were three patterns, but here they're missing or not properly defined.\n\nI need to generate a new rule with three different 6-20 byte patterns, each including wildcards for addresses or offsets. Also, add the correct meta section with description and cape_options.\n\nSo, I'll create three distinct patterns based on the provided traces. Each pattern should combine nearby instructions into one, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nFor example, take a look at the trace data: there are multiple calls to E8250500h and similar. Maybe each pattern can capture different sequences around these CALL instructions with wildcards for any addresses or offsets.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is unique, uses wildcards correctly, and fits within 6-20 bytes. Then, I'll structure the meta section properly with a description and the necessary cape_options.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting sample addresses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`. CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the Yara rule based on the given information. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user provided a previous attempt at a Yara rule that failed validation. The main issues were pattern lengths and the presence of too many patterns. The error messages indicated that each pattern was too short (4 bytes) and that more than 3 were defined, which is invalid as only $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2 are allowed.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can see several points where calls might be made, such as lines with E825050000 or other call instructions. My task is to extract three distinct patterns from these traces, each 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nI'll analyze the trace data:\n\n1. In TRACE #1 and #3, there's an E8 instruction followed by a displacement. I can create a pattern starting with E8 and including four wildcard bytes.\n2. In TRACE #2, there are multiple E8 instructions; one has 05 after E8, so another pattern could include E8 with ?? instead of 05.\n3. Another point is line 0040E7C3h in TRACE #3 where the call instruction might be captured.\n\nI'll construct each pattern by combining two or more consecutive instructions and replacing address/offsets with wildcards, keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that each pattern is unique and exactly three are present. Also, I must include the correct cape_options in the meta section.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific call patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 75 ?? ???? 03 04 8B CC ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
