        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the Yara rule because the previous attempt had invalid patterns that were too short. The error was that each pattern needed to be at least 6 bytes long, but they were only 4. Let me look at the trace data provided to figure out suitable instructions.\n\nFirst, let's examine the instruction sequence. I see several calls and jumps in the trace:\n\n- Line 1: 85C0 test eax, eax\n- Line 2: 7412 je ...\n- Line 3: 6A5B push...\n- Line 4: 5A pop...\n- Line 5: 8BCE mov ecx, esi\n- Line 6: E825 call...\n- Then again at line 9: test eax, eax, and so on.\n\nI notice that the function calls (E8) are followed by various operations. Maybe I can capture a few instructions around these points to create patterns.\n\nFor pattern0, maybe look at the first few instructions after a test. Let's see:\n\n85C0 is test eax, then 7412 je. So combining them: 85 C0 74 12 ?? ?? ?? Wait, but I need at least 6 bytes. Maybe include more to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first test and the conditional jump:\n\nLine 3: 6A5B push... then line 4 is 5A pop..., so pushing and popping might be part of a bypass attempt. Combining these with an instruction after.\n\nAnother point is the call at E825 (line 6). Maybe include that in a pattern. So something like E825 followed by other instructions.\n\nWait, let me check the trace:\n\nAt line 1: 85C0 test\nLine 3: 6A5B push...\nLine 4: 5A pop...\nLine 5: 8BCE mov...\nLine 6: E825 call...\n\nSo maybe create three different patterns:\n\n1. Pattern0 captures the first test and a conditional jump.\n2. Pattern1 includes pushing, popping, and moving.\n3. Pattern2 looks at an E8 instruction with some offset.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for unknown or variable offsets.\n\nLet me draft them:\n\nPattern0: test eax, then je. So maybe 85C0 (test), 7412 (je), and some context after.\nBut wait, line 1 is 85C0, line 2 is 7412. Maybe combine with an instruction after.\n\nAlternatively, take the first few instructions: 85 C0 74 12 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's 6 bytes already (including two wildcards). But maybe I can get more instructions to make it longer.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLine 1: 85C0 test eax, eax\nLine 2: 7412 je offset\nLine 3: 6A5B push... etc.\n\nSo combining line 1 and part of line 2: 85 C0 74 12 ?? That's only 5 bytes. Maybe add another instruction after.\n\nAlternatively, take line 3 onwards:\n\n6A5B (push), then 5A pop..., so maybe combine these with something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to include more instructions from different parts of the trace.\n\nLet me think about creating three distinct patterns, each around a call or jump.\n\nPattern0: E825 (call) followed by some instructions.\nPattern1: Some push, pop, and mov before a conditional.\nPattern2: Another sequence after another test.\n\nI need to ensure that all offsets are replaced with ?? except for known opcodes and register encodings.\n\nLet me try:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 ?? ???? }\n\nWait, but I think combining more instructions would make it better. Maybe include the next instruction after je: perhaps a comparison or something else.\n\nAlternatively, take E825 (line6), which is call, then maybe some other instruction like mov.\n\nSo:\n\nE825 (call) followed by 8BCE (mov). So E8 25 8B CE ?? ??\n\nThat's 6 bytes. Maybe add a few more instructions after that to make it longer.\n\nAlternatively, take the push, pop, and mov sequence: 6A 5B 5A 8B CE\n\nBut I need to include offsets where applicable.\n\nHmm, perhaps:\n\n$pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\nThat's six bytes with wildcards. But maybe add more instructions after.\n\nWait, line6 is E825 (call), then line7: 3C40 je near something.\n\nSo combining call and je near:\n\nE825 3C40 ... but that might be too far apart.\n\nAlternatively, focus on lines where the function calls are made. Let me pick three different call sequences.\n\nFirst pattern: E825 (call) followed by some displacement.\nSecond: Another call with a different offset.\nThird: Yet another call sequence.\n\nI think I can construct three patterns each around 6-10 bytes, using wildcards where needed.\n\nLet me structure them:\n\nPattern0: test, je\nPattern1: push, pop, mov\nPattern2: E8 near (with displacement)\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 ?? ???? }\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes. Let me include another instruction.\n\nWhat if I take the first four instructions: test, je, push, pop?\n\nSo 85C0 (test), 7412 (je), 6A5B (push), 5A0F (pop). That's eight bytes:\n\n85 C0 74 12 6A 5B 5A 0F\n\nWait, but line3 is 6A5B push..., so instruction 3 is 6A followed by 5B. Then instruction4 is 5A pop... So 5A (pop) then 8BCE.\n\nHmm, maybe combine these:\n\n6A 5B 5A 8B CE ?? ??\n\nThat's eight bytes with two wildcards.\n\n$pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\nWait, line6 is E825 (call). Maybe include that in another pattern.\n\nBut perhaps each pattern should focus on a specific call or jump sequence.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern0: test eax, je\nPattern1: push, pop, mov\nPattern2: E8 near\n\nLet me try to create them step by step.\n\nFor Pattern0:\n- Line 1: test eax (85C0)\n- Line 2: je (7412)\n\nSo combining these two instructions and a few bytes after:\n\ntest (85 C0), je (74 12), then maybe the next instruction is a comparison, but it's not clear. Alternatively, take line1 to line3.\n\nBut I think better to focus on specific instruction sequences that are likely to be used in an evasion bypass.\n\nPerhaps capture E8 call followed by a near jmp.\n\nSo Pattern0: E825 (call) with some displacement and then another instruction.\n\nSimilarly for the other patterns.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and captures different parts of the trace.\n\nAlright, I think I have three distinct patterns now. Let me write them down.\n</think>\n\nTo address the previous errors, we'll create a Yara rule with exactly three 6-20-byte patterns derived from the provided trace data, using wildcards for address/offset bytes and keeping opcode and register encodings concrete.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting function calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 E8 ?? }   # Test eax followed by je and call\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5B 5A 8B CE E8 ?? } # Push, pop, mov before a call\n        $pattern2 = { E8 3C 0F C4 ?? ?? ?? } # Call with near jump\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
