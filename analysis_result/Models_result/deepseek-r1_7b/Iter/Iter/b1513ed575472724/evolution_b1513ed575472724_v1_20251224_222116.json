      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the Yara rule based on the provided information. The original rule failed because it didn't meet certain requirements, specifically in having three different patterns each of 6-20 bytes and applying wildcards correctly.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, I see that there are three traces with similar paths. Each involves a call to an external function (E8F7250000) followed by some operations like TEST EAX and JNE, then moving data into EBP or ESI, etc.\n\nI need to extract three distinct patterns from these calls. Let me think about how each instruction is structured in the trace.\n\nFor example, one of the instructions is:\nE8F7250000       call 0041DF02h\nThen, TEST EAX with a value (0x01), followed by JNE or JE depending on the offset. After that, moving data into EBP.\n\nSo each pattern can be built from these steps: the call instruction, the subsequent conditional jump (which could vary between JZ, JNE, etc.), and then some specific operations.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is unique and only covers the necessary instructions to avoid overlaps. Also, I need to replace all address/offset bytes with ?? as per Yara's wildcard rules.\n\nLet me draft three patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: The call followed by JZ (Jump if Zero) based on EAX.\n2. Pattern 1: A different conditional jump, perhaps JNE or JE, depending on the offset.\n3. Pattern 2: Another variation where the target is different, maybe moving data into a different register.\n\nWait, looking at the trace, I notice that in each case, after the call, there's a TEST EAX and then either JNE or JE based on whether the test result is zero. The offset after the call varies (0x84, 0x25, etc.), which can be replaced with ??.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could capture calls where the offset after the call leads to a specific target, say 0x84.\nPattern 1 could capture another offset, like 0x25.\nPattern 2 might cover cases where the conditional jump is different or the test result varies.\n\nWait, but the original patterns need to be distinct. Let me structure them accordingly:\n\n- Pattern 0: call E8F7..., then JZ on EAX with offset 0x84 and specific operations after like TEST EAX, JNE 0x1h.\n- Pattern 1: similar steps but different offsets or test/conditional jumps.\n- Pattern 2: another variation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pattern can capture a different instruction sequence. For example:\n\nPattern 0: call followed by JZ with offset and then specific operations.\nPattern 1: call followed by JNE and so on.\nPattern 2: another conditional after the call but differing in some way.\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards where applicable, and doesn't repeat any sequences. Also, each must be specific enough to only match the target location.\n\nLet me try writing them:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 call, then JZ with offset ??, TEST EAX, JNE 0x1h.\nWait, but in the trace, after TEST EAX comes either JNE or JE. The offset is either 0x84 (for some) and others are different.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 call, then TEST EAX 0x01h, JZ ??.\nWait, but in the trace, it's either JNE or JE based on whether the test is zero. So perhaps Pattern 0 could be when it's JNE.\n\nBut I need to think about how each pattern differs. Let me look at the trace again:\n\nIn all three traces, after the call, there's a TEST EAX and then a conditional jump (JNE or JE). But in one case, the offset is different: for example, 0x84 in some cases.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer:\n\n- In the first two traces, the offset is 0x25 after the call.\n- The third trace has an offset of 0x84.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 0 can be when the offset is 0x25 and action is JNE.\nPattern 1 could be when the offset is different (like 0x84) with a different conditional, or same but test differently.\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn all cases after the call, it's TEST EAX 0x01h, then either JNE 0x25h or JE 0x25h.\n\nBut in one case, maybe the offset is 0x84 and action is different?\n\nWait, looking at the trace data:\n\nFor all three, after the call (E8F7...), TEST EAX, then either JNE or JE based on the value. The offsets vary between 0x25 and 0x84.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 0: E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, JZ ??.\nPattern 1: E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, JNE ??.\nPattern 2: Same but with a different offset for the conditional jump or target.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each trace:\n\n- First and second traces have after call: TEST EAX 0x01h, then JNE 0x85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (offset is 0x25).\n- Third trace has same steps but offset is 0x84.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, JNE 0x85 C0 0F 84 ??.\nWait, no. The action after JNE is a conditional jump with an offset of 0x25 in first two traces.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, JZ 0x84 (offset).\nPattern 1: E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, JNE 0x25.\nPattern 2: Same steps but different action?\n\nWait, no. Let me structure each pattern:\n\nEach pattern must be a sequence of instructions that can trigger the bypass.\n\nSo for Pattern 0:\n- call E8F7...\n- TEST EAX 0x01h\n- JNE ?? (since in trace it's JNE with offset 0x25)\n\nBut I need to represent this as bytes. For example:\n\nE8 F7 25 00 00 is the call, then TEST EAX 0x01.\n\nWait, no: In the first two traces, after the call (E8F7...), it's TEST EAX 0x01h followed by JNE ??.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be:\n\nE8 F7 25 00 00 (call)\nTEST EAX 01\nJNE ??\n\nBut in Yara, each instruction is represented as bytes with hex values. So let's convert these to their hex representations and apply wildcards where necessary.\n\nSo Pattern 0: E8F7250000 call, then TEST EAX 0x01h (bytes: 74 89 30), then JNE followed by an offset which can be replaced with ??.\n\nWait, but the offset after JNE is variable. So in the trace, it's either 0x25 or something else?\n\nLooking at the traces:\n\n- First two have E8F7... call, then TEST EAX 0x01h, then JNE followed by 0x25.\nWait, no: In the first two traces, after JNE comes a comparison with al.\n\nIn the third trace, it's similar but offset is different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nEach pattern should be specific to certain steps:\n\nPattern 0: call E8F7..., then TEST EAX 0x01h, then JZ ?? (action depends on EAX)\nWait, no. The action after the conditional jump varies between JNE and JE based on whether the test is zero.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 0: call E8F7... followed by TEST EAX 0x01h, then JNE with a known offset.\nBut since in some traces it's JNE and others might be different, I need to capture all possibilities but split them into distinct patterns.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern can represent a specific variation:\n\nPattern 0: call E8F7..., TEST EAX 0x01h, then JNE (with any offset)\nPattern 1: same steps but JZ\nPattern 2: same steps but with different action or target\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the conditional jump's target is different in each case, perhaps I can create patterns based on that.\n\nLooking at the traces:\n\n- In the first two, after the call and TEST EAX, it's JNE followed by a comparison.\nWait, no: The next instruction is 74 20 which is JE or JZ? Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the first trace:\nAfter call (E8F7...), TEST EAX, then 74 20. What does that mean?\n\nLooking at Yara's opcode meanings:\n\n- 74: Conditional jump\n   - 74 01: JZ (Jump if Zero)\n   - 74 05: JNZ (Jump if Not Zero)\n   - 74 85: JNE (Jump if EAX != 0)\n   - 74 20: JE (Jump if EAX == 0)\n\nWait, so in the first two traces:\n\nAfter TEST EAX, it's 74 20 which is JE. But that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nIn the third trace, after TEST EAX, it's also 74 20 (JE), but then the offset varies: 0x84 in one case and perhaps others are different.\n\nWait, looking at the first two traces:\n\n- After call, TEST EAX, then 74 20 (JE). Then a comparison with AL: 75 10. If AL is zero, it jumps again to the same place.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me parse each instruction step by step for one trace.\n\nTake the first trace:\n\n0041B901 8BFF             mov edi, edi\n0041B903 55               push ebp\n0041B904 8BEC             mov ebp, esp\n0041B906 E8F7250000       call 0041DF02h\n0041B90B 83F801           cmp eax, 01h\n0041B90E 74 20            je (JZ or JE based on EAX)\n0041B91C A801              test al, 01h\n0041B91E 75 10            jne ... \n\nWait, so after the call (E8F7...), it's 83 F8 01 which is CMP EAX, 0x01. Then 74 20 (JE if EAX == 0). So in this case, it's a JE.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was JNE. Hmm.\n\nWait, no: the instruction is 74 20, which is JE. So the conditional jump depends on EAX. If EAX is zero, it jumps to the next target (0041B93C), else continues.\n\nSo in this case, after the call and TEST EAX, it's a JE based on EAX.\n\nBut then why did I think there was a JNE? Maybe that's incorrect.\n\nWait, looking back at the first trace:\n\nThe instruction after the call is 83 F801 which is CMP EAX, 0x01h. Then comes 74 20 (JE if EAX == 0), then TEST AL, etc.\n\nSo in this case, it's a JE, not JNE. So my earlier assumption was wrong. That changes things.\n\nGiven that, all three traces have similar structures:\n\ncall E8F7..., then TEST EAX, then JE or maybe another conditional based on EAX.\n\nWait, no: looking at the third trace, after call and TEST EAX comes 74 20 (JE), same as others.\n\nSo perhaps all patterns involve a JE after TEST EAX. Then, in the next instruction, it's comparing AL with 0x01h, which causes another conditional jump or continues.\n\nWait, but this is getting too detailed for my current thought process. I need to focus on creating three distinct patterns each of 6-20 bytes.\n\nLet me try to create Pattern 0 as:\n\nE8F7250000 call\nTEST EAX 0x01h\nJE ?? \n\nPattern 1 could be similar but with a different offset after the JE, but since all have same offset, maybe it's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps another variation.\n\nWait, in one of the traces, after the call and TEST EAX comes a different instruction sequence leading to different behavior. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the first trace:\n\nAfter 74 20 (JE), it goes to:\nA801: test al, 0x01h\n75 10: jne 0x01h al\n\nSo after that, it's a JNE based on AL.\n\nBut in another case? Let me see:\n\nWait, no, all three traces follow the same sequence after TEST EAX and JE. So perhaps each pattern is similar but differ in the specific instructions leading to the bypass.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider different target locations or instruction sequences that could be bypassed.\n\nAnother approach: Each bypass candidate can exploit a different instruction path within the same function call. For example:\n\n- One bypass jumps over the call and some instructions.\n- Another uses a different offset in the call.\n\nBut since all traces have similar structures, perhaps each pattern captures a slight variation in the number of instructions before the conditional jump or target displacement.\n\nSo, let's create three patterns with varying instruction counts after the call but same overall structure:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (call) + TEST EAX + JE ?? \nPattern 1: Same as Pattern 0 but includes more instructions before the conditional jump.\nWait, no. All have TEST EAX and then JE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pattern captures a different instruction after the call:\n\nBut since all are similar, perhaps I can vary the number of bytes between the call and the conditional jump by including more instructions in the pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (4 bytes) + TEST EAX (4 bytes) + JE ??? (varies)\nPattern 1: Includes one more instruction after the call before reaching the conditional.\nWait, but that's not possible since all follow the same steps.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to structure each pattern with a specific number of bytes and ensure they are unique.\n\nAnother approach is to capture different target addresses by including offsets from different parts:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (call) + TEST EAX + JZ ?? \nPattern 1: Same as Pattern 0 but JNE instead\nPattern 2: Different action or instruction after the conditional.\n\nWait, no. All are JE in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern includes different numbers of instructions before reaching the bypass point:\n\n- Pattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JE ??? (varies)\n- Pattern 1: E8F7... (5) + TEST EAX (4) + JE ??? \nWait, but the call is fixed as E8F7250000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern includes different instruction sequences after the call:\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 call, then TEST EAX, then JZ with a specific offset.\nPattern 1: Same but JNE with another offset.\nPattern 2: Different action or target.\n\nBut in this case, all have JE as the conditional jump. So perhaps I can vary the number of bytes by including more instructions before the conditional.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern includes different numbers of instructions after the call:\n\n- Pattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JE ??? \n- Pattern 1: E8F7... (5) + TEST EAX (4) + JE ??? \n- Pattern 2: E8F7... (6) + TEST EAX (4) + JE ??? \n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern is unique in terms of instruction sequence and has a specific target.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern can capture different parts after the call:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ?? \nPattern 1: Same as Pattern 0 but with an additional instruction before JZ.\nWait, no. The trace shows that after the call and TEST EAX comes the conditional jump.\n\nI think I need to create three distinct patterns by varying the number of instructions between key points while ensuring each is 6-20 bytes long.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??\nThis would be 12 bytes, but JZ only takes three operands. Wait, no: the pattern is a sequence of instructions and their hex values with wildcards.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern can be built by including more bytes after the call:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ?? (3 operands)\nTotal: 11 bytes. But Yara requires at least 6-20, so this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, including more instructions might be better to make it specific:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ?? -> 11 bytes\nPattern 1: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JNE ?? -> 11 bytes, but if the conditional is different.\nWait, no. In all traces, it's JE.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to vary other parts:\n\nLooking back at the strings after the call and TEST EAX, in one trace there's an A801: test al, 0x01h followed by jne ... Maybe another pattern can include that.\n\nBut since all have similar steps, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps each pattern represents a different bypass path within the function:\n\nPattern 0: Call E8F7..., TEST EAX, JZ ?? \nPattern 1: Call E8F7..., TEST EAX, then move to another instruction before conditional.\nBut that would require more instructions.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in one trace, after the call and TEST EAX, it's a different number of bytes before the next jump. For example:\n\n- Trace 1: After call (E8F7...), TEST EAX, then JZ (3 operands)\n- Trace 2: After call, TEST EAX, then move to another instruction before conditional.\n\nBut since all are similar, perhaps it's better to create patterns based on the offset after the call:\n\nPattern 0: Call with offset 0x84\nPattern 1: Call with offset 0x25 (as in traces 1 and 2)\nPattern 2: Another offset or different action.\n\nWait, but I need three distinct patterns. Let's try:\n\nPattern 0:\n- E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ?? \n\nBut this is too vague. Alternatively:\n\nEach pattern can include the call instruction followed by a specific sequence of operations leading to the bypass.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern captures a different number of instructions after the call before reaching the conditional jump or target displacement.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??? (3 operands)\nPattern 1: E8F7... (5) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??? \nWait, but the call is fixed as E8F7250000. So including more bytes after that would require additional instructions.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??\nPattern 1: E8F7250000 (4) + TEST EAX (4) + move ?? \nWait, but the pattern needs to be a specific instruction sequence.\n\nI think I need to make each pattern as follows:\n\n- Pattern 0 captures calls where after TEST EAX comes JZ with offset 0x84\n- Pattern 1 captures calls where after TEST EAX comes JNE with offset 0x25\n- Pattern 2 captures a different variation, maybe involving another instruction before the conditional.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each pattern can be:\n\nPattern 0: call + TEST EAX + JZ (offset known)\nPattern 1: same but action is different\nPattern 2: different target or instruction after.\n\nWait, since all have JZ with similar parameters, maybe it's impossible to create three distinct patterns. But the requirement says exactly three patterns, so I must find a way.\n\nPerhaps each pattern can represent a slight variation in the number of instructions between key points:\n\nPattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??? (3)\nPattern 1: E8F7... (5) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ???\nBut this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the call could be followed by different instruction sequences leading to the same conditional jump. For example:\n\n- Pattern 0: E8F7... (4) + TEST EAX (4) + JZ ??? \n- Pattern 1: E8F7... (5) + TEST EAX (4) + move ???\nWait, but I'm not sure what's after the call.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess based on the given traces and create three patterns that each capture a specific bypass path with wildcards for addresses.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 F7 25 00 00 A8 01 } // This pattern captures the first bypass candidate with a specific offset\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? } // This pattern captures another bypass candidate with different instruction sequence\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help improve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace data and previous attempts. The current best rule didn't find any new signatures, meaning it matched but didn't effectively bypass the malware evasion.\n\nFirst, looking at the traces provided, each has several instructions that could be potential bypass points. Strategy A involves checking early in the trace for a call-test-je pattern, which seems promising because if the previous attempt used this and failed, maybe the specific instruction sequence was too broad or not precise enough.\n\nIn the first trace, there's an E8F7250000 call followed by a test and jne. Maybe the issue was that the original pattern didn't capture all possible variations of these instructions. By being more specific with exact hex values from the trace, I can create a tighter match.\n\nNext, Strategy B suggests looking before the exit calls for conditional checks. The traces show multiple instances where after a call to an external function (like 0041DF02h), there's a test and jne. These seem like good candidates because if the bypass is happening too late, maybe adding a condition before could prevent termination.\n\nFinally, Strategy C allows for other techniques, but since previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, sticking with known effective strategies might be better. Including patterns from Strategy A and B would cover both early checks and exit decisions.\n\nBy selecting specific instruction sequences from the trace data, each pattern will target different points where the bypass could occur without matching too broadly. Using wildcards for varying offsets ensures that we don't match unintended locations while still capturing the intended ones effectively.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Potential Bypass Points:** The traces show calls to external functions followed by conditional checks (test and jne). These serve as good candidates because they indicate decision points in the program flow.\n\n2. **Develop Specific Patterns:** Extract exact instruction sequences from the trace data:\n   - **Pattern 1:** Early call-test-je sequence\n   - **Pattern 2:** Conditional check before exit call\n   - **Pattern 3:** Another conditional test after an external function\n\n3. **Ensure Specificity and Momentum:** By using concrete hex values, each pattern is more specific but still broad enough to match intended bypass points while avoiding false positives.\n\n4. **Apply Best Practices:** Each pattern adheres to the 6-20 byte requirement and uses wildcards for address/offset variations, ensuring precise matching without causing program crashes.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The improved rule focuses on more specific instruction sequences from the trace data, targeting early calls followed by conditional checks before exit points. This strategy ensures higher specificity to avoid false matches while maintaining momentum to effectively bypass the evasion.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 80\n\n**REASONING:** The evolved patterns use exact hex sequences from known malicious traces, targeting early conditional checks and exit decision points for effective bypass without matching unintended locations. This approach balances specificity with broader coverage to improve success rates.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved specific instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC ?? ?? ?? ??

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix the Yara rule because the previous attempt had errors. The main issue is that the pattern lengths are too short. Each pattern needs to be at least 6 bytes but can't be longer than 20. \n\nLooking at the original patterns:\n- $pattern0: 85 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? (Only 6 bytes, which might not be enough)\n- $pattern1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (Only 5 bytes, way too short)\n- $pattern2: 6A ?? 5A ?? ?? ?? ?? (Too long with 8 bytes)\n\nI need to make each pattern between 6 and 20 bytes. Also, all address/offset bytes must be replaced with ??.\n\nLet me think about the instructions from the trace data. The exit process calls functions like E8, then some other steps, and finally a call at 0041B93C or similar. \n\nFor $pattern0: Maybe take E8 as the start of a call instruction.\nE8 is followed by four bytes for the offset. So if I replace those with ??, it becomes E8 followed by five bytes (including opcode), making total 6.\n\nSo pattern0 could be \"E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\".\n\nFor $pattern1: Maybe another function call after that, like 0F 84 being part of a different instruction.\nLooking at the trace, there's a 8B 45 which is a mov instruction. Let me see:\n8B 45 is followed by some bytes. So perhaps combining this into a longer pattern.\n\nWait, maybe $pattern1 could be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? that. But I need to make sure it's from the trace. Alternatively, think of another call sequence.\n\nAlternatively, take E8 again but with more context: E8 followed by four ??. So total of five bytes after opcode? Wait, E8 is one byte, then four for the offset makes 5, so including the opcode that's six bytes in total. So maybe:\n\npattern0: E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\nThat's 6 bytes.\n\nBut wait, how many bytes are needed? The pattern must be at least 6, but combining two instructions would make more. Maybe take a longer sequence to get higher specificity.\n\nLooking back at the examples provided:\nGood example was TEST + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes.\nAnother was PUSH + POP + MOV +_CALL = 12 bytes.\n\nSo perhaps each pattern can be 8-10 bytes if using two instructions (including op and offset).\n\nLet me re-examine the trace. \n\nIn the first call, after E8 F725..., which is a call instruction with displacement. So maybe $pattern0 could capture that.\n\nE8 is followed by four bytes for the displacement. But since we need to make it 6-20 bytes, perhaps include more context around this call.\n\nLooking at the trace again:\n\nFor example, in TRACE #1:\n0041B906 E8F7250000       call 0041DF02h\n\nSo E8 is followed by F7 (displacement). So to capture that, maybe take E8 and then the next few bytes.\n\nBut since displacement is four bytes (F7 is one byte?), wait no: displacement in 32-bit offset can be up to four bytes. But each call's offset is typically a short or near jump. \n\nAlternatively, think of another way. Let me try to find three different sequences from the trace that are about function calls and their surrounding instructions.\n\n1. E8 F7 ... (call with displacement)\n2. 0F 84 ... (another instruction)\n3. 6A ?? ...\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes.\n\nLet me try constructing them:\n\npattern0: E8 followed by five ??. So \"E8\" + 5 more bytes as ?. Total of 6 bytes.\npattern1: Maybe a different call, like FF75... from the trace. For example, FF75 is part of a function call with displacement.\n\nWait, in the first call, it's E8F7250000 which is call to 0041DF02h. So the bytes are E8 F7 25 00 00 00. But maybe we can take a longer sequence around this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the function call where it's moved after another instruction.\n\nWait, let me think of each pattern as two instructions: opcode and its next few bytes (displacement or other).\n\nFor $pattern0:\nTake E8 as the call opcode, followed by four displacement bytes. So \"E8\" + 4 ?? = total 5 bytes? But needs to be at least 6, so maybe include the next instruction.\n\nWait, after E8 comes F725..., which is part of the displacement. Maybe capture more context around it.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each pattern should consist of the target instruction plus surrounding context instructions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's take a few consecutive bytes from the trace for each pattern, ensuring they are specific enough but long enough (6-20 bytes).\n\nLooking at the first call in TRACE #1:\n\nE8 F7 25 00 00 00 is part of the instruction. But E8F725... can be considered as a single instruction with displacement, which is four bytes.\n\nSo for pattern0: \"E8\" + \"F7 25 00 00\". Wait, but that's only 6 bytes? Let me count:\n\nE8 (1) F7 (2), 25 (3), 00 (4), 00 (5), 00 (6). So total of 6 bytes.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be \"E8F7250000\" but that's 9 bytes, which is over the limit. Instead, take a subset: E8 followed by four ??.\n\nBut wait, F7 is part of displacement, so maybe we can't replace it with ??. Alternatively, perhaps capture more context.\n\nAlternatively, if I include more bytes after E8 to make the pattern longer but still within 20.\n\nLet me try \"E8F7\" as the first two bytes. Then include four ?? for displacement: total of 6.\n\nWait, that's only 5 bytes. Hmm. Maybe take E8 followed by five bytes (including F7), making it 6.\n\nSo $pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? } but replacing the last three with ??. So \"E8F725\" is 6 bytes, then next four are ????\n\nWait no: total would be 10 bytes if I include after displacement. Maybe it's better to take a longer sequence.\n\nAlternatively, think of another instruction in the trace that can form a specific pattern.\n\nLooking at other parts:\n\nIn TRACE #3:\nAt line 0041B93C, there are some calls: E8 F7..., then later FF75... which is another call with displacement.\n\nSo maybe $pattern1 could be \"FF75\" followed by ???\n\nBut to make it specific, let's take FF and the next four bytes as ???. So \"FF7500???\" but need exact count.\n\nAlternatively, since this might not cover enough context, perhaps combine multiple instructions into a longer pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Take E8F725... which is 6 bytes (E8 F7 25 00 00 00). But that's only six, so maybe include more:\n\nWait, the displacement in E8 can be up to four bytes. So if I take \"E8\" + \"F7 25 00\", which is five bytes, then add a ?? to make it six? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me try this approach: Each pattern should consist of two consecutive instructions (opcode and next instruction). For example:\n\npattern0: E8 followed by F7. So \"E8F7\" plus displacement as ??: making total 6 bytes.\n\nBut wait, that's only four bytes after E8? Maybe better to include more context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps capture a longer sequence where the call is part of the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe for $pattern0: The call instruction at E8 followed by F725 and then some other bytes. So \"E8F725\" plus ???\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes (E8, F7, 25, 00, 00, 00). But wait, in the code provided earlier, the pattern for TEST EAX + JZ + MOV is 11 bytes. So maybe each of my patterns should be longer.\n\nWait, looking at the user's example:\n\n\"85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? \" which is 12 bytes (including all the ??.)\n\nSo perhaps I can take two instructions into account, like opcode and offset, plus any other bytes related to that instruction.\n\nFor $pattern0: E8 followed by four displacement bytes. So \"E8 F7 25 00 00 00\" is nine bytes but over the limit. Instead, make it six bytes by truncating after the first two instructions:\n\nWait, perhaps take E8 and then five ??: so E8 followed by five ?? making total of six.\n\nBut that's just replacing displacement with ?. So \"E8\" + \"F7 25\" as fixed, then four ?: making E8 F7 25 followed by four ?. Wait, but how to represent that.\n\nAlternatively, consider the entire call instruction: E8F7250000. That's nine bytes (including the displacement). But I need it to be 6-20, so perhaps take \"E8F7\" plus ???: making six bytes.\n\nWait, no, because F7 is part of the displacement, which can't be replaced with ?. So maybe instead include more context around this call.\n\nAlternatively, think about another function call in the trace. For example, the call at 021EBBA3h: E8F725... similar to the first one. Maybe $pattern1 could capture that.\n\nSo pattern1 would be \"E8\" followed by F7 and displacement as ?, making six bytes again.\n\nBut maybe I need to make each pattern longer. Let me try:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? } → 6 bytes\nWait, but the actual call is E8F7250000, so after E8F7 comes 25 followed by four zeros. If I take \"E8F7\" as fixed and then replace the displacement (the next three bytes) with ??, that's five bytes: total of six.\n\nBut wait, F7 is part of the displacement; perhaps it can't be replaced? Or maybe in this context, it's considered an address so should be replaced. Hmm, but in the code example, all address/offset are replaced with ??. So even if F7 is part of the displacement, replace it with ??.\n\nSo pattern0 would be E8 followed by five ??: \"E8??????\" which is six bytes.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1: Maybe another call instruction elsewhere. Let's look at the trace:\n\nIn TRACE #2 and #3, there are calls starting with E8F7... So perhaps I can use that again but from a different part of the code.\n\nBut wait, to make each pattern unique, they need to come from different parts. Maybe $pattern1 is another instruction sequence like 0F 84 followed by some ??: \"0F84????\" which would be six bytes.\n\nAnd $pattern2 could be something else, maybe a different function call: for example, FF75... So \"FF75????\", making it six bytes.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure the patterns are specific enough. Maybe include more context around these calls to make them unique.\n\nAlternatively, think of combining multiple instructions into each pattern. For example:\n\npattern0: E8 (call) + F7 25 followed by some other instruction's part.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to have each pattern as a complete instruction with displacement.\n\nSo final approach:\n- $pattern0: E8F7250000 → but that's nine bytes; can't be. Instead, take \"E8\" + five ?? for displacement, making six.\n- $pattern1: 0F84 followed by four ?, making total of five? No, need at least six. So maybe include more context after the call.\n\nWait, perhaps I can capture a longer sequence around these calls to make each pattern unique and meet the length requirement.\n\nAnother idea: Instead of just taking displacement bytes, combine with some next instructions' bytes that are known in the trace.\n\nFor example, after E8F725..., there's 0x0000003C. So maybe include those as well to make the pattern longer.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be \"E8 F7 25 00 00 3C\" but that's six bytes: E8 (1), F7 (2), 25 (3), 00 (4), 00 (5), 3C (6). That makes it exactly six bytes.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1 and $pattern2, find other instruction sequences with similar surrounding context to capture longer patterns.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nIn TRACE #2: E8F725... followed by ????\n\nAnd in TRACE #3, same call structure. So maybe I can create a pattern that captures this specific call plus some following instructions.\n\nSo $pattern1 could be \"E8 F7 25 00 00 ??\" (assuming ?? after the zeros). But need to check if that's six bytes.\n\nAlternatively, think of another instruction sequence elsewhere in the trace. For example, looking for a different function call:\n\nIn the first call: E8F725...\nIn the second call: same\nLooking at other parts: There are some 6A ?? ... calls which could be part of a different pattern.\n\nSo $pattern1: Maybe the instruction 0F84 followed by something. Looking in the trace, perhaps after 0F84 comes 8B45... which is another instruction.\n\nBut to make it specific, maybe take \"0F 84\" plus some other bytes as ?: but need at least six.\n\nAlternatively, look for a different function call, like FF75..., similar to the others. So $pattern2: \"FF75 ?????\" (six bytes).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 00 00 3C }\n$pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n$pattern2 = { FF75 ?????? }\n\nWait, but need to make sure each pattern is unique and from different parts.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nAnother approach: Since all the calls in the trace are using E8 with similar displacement structures, perhaps I can use a longer sequence that includes more context around this call. For example, including some bytes after the function call's return address.\n\nLooking at the first call:\nE8F7250000 → returns to 0041B93C\n\nIn the trace data, there are calls returning to various addresses like 0041B93C and others. So maybe include some bytes from after these return points.\n\nFor example, in $pattern0: E8F725... followed by some known instruction at address 0041B93C.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Maybe stick to the call details but make each pattern longer by including more context around the call.\n\nAlternatively, take two consecutive instructions for each pattern and include their offset bytes as ??: \n\npattern0: E8 (call) + F725 followed by ?? → \"E8F725???\", making nine bytes. But that's over 20; need to truncate.\n\nWait, maybe just focus on the call instruction itself without worrying about context:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 00 00 00 } (six bytes)\nBut displacement can't be part of a pattern as it's address-based. So perhaps represent that with ??: making \"E8\" followed by five ?: which is six.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1: Maybe another function call elsewhere in the code but similar structure.\n\nWait, let me check if any other function calls are present:\n\nLooking through the trace data, most calls are from E8F725... and FF75..., so perhaps I can create patterns based on those.\n\nSo final attempt:\n- $pattern0: E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? (six bytes)\n- $pattern1: FF75 ??? ???? (eight bytes)\nBut need to make sure each is at least six. Also, ensure they are unique and specific enough.\n\nWait, maybe for $pattern1, take the next few instructions after a call:\n\nAfter E8F725..., there's 0x0000003C, which is another instruction: C1E8... \n\nSo perhaps include that in the pattern. But I need to make it specific.\n\nAlternatively, for $pattern1: Take FF75 followed by ????, making six bytes.\n\nBut maybe better to have more context:\n\n$pattern1 = { FF 75 ???? ?? ?? } (eight bytes)\n\nAnd similarly for $pattern2: Maybe take another function call elsewhere in the code with similar displacement.\n\nAlternatively, think of another instruction that can form a longer pattern. For example, after E8F7... is a mov instruction:\n\nLooking at the first call: After E8F7250000 (call), the next instruction is 83C4 ???\n\nSo $pattern1 could be \"FF75\" followed by some other bytes.\n\nBut to make it unique, maybe take FF75 plus some following instructions' data as ?: \n\n$pattern1 = { FF75 8B45 ???? } (but need exact count)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to create patterns based on the return addresses in the trace. For example:\n\nAfter each call instruction, there's a return address. So if I can capture that, maybe make a pattern around it.\n\nBut without knowing the exact return address bytes, it's hard. Alternatively, think of another approach: Use the fact that all calls are returning to certain addresses and include those in the patterns as fixed bytes followed by ??: \n\nFor example:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ???0 } (including a known return address)\nBut I need exact hex values. Looking at the trace data, after each call, it returns to an address like 0041B93C or similar.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be \"E8F725\" followed by some bytes from 0041B93C: \n\nBut I don't know those exact hex values. Alternatively, perhaps replace all displacement and return addresses with ??: \n\nThus:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ???0 } → but can't do that because specific address is needed.\n\nWait, without knowing the exact return address bytes, it's difficult to include them as fixed in the pattern. So maybe better to create a pattern based on the call instruction and its displacement, ignoring the return address for now.\n\nThus:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ??? } (six bytes)\n\nSimilarly, $pattern1 could be another function call elsewhere: FF75 followed by some ??: \"FF75?? ?? ???\"\n\nBut to make each pattern unique, perhaps combine two different instruction sequences. For example, one based on E8F7... and another based on 0F84...\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is:\n\n- $pattern0: E8 F7 25 followed by four ??: making six bytes.\n- $pattern1: 0F 84 followed by five ?: nine bytes. Truncate to six by taking first three fixed and four ?: \"0F84?? ??\"\nBut need exact count.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think of how the initial example was structured:\n\nThe initial rule had patterns like TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes.\n\nSo each pattern can be a sequence of multiple instructions where some are fixed (like opcode) and others replaced with ?: \n\nFor $pattern0: Take two consecutive instructions, fix their opcodes, replace other bytes with ??: for example:\n\nE8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? → six bytes\n\nSimilarly, find another instruction pair in the trace to form a different pattern.\n\nIn the trace data, after E8F7... comes 0x83C4. So $pattern1 could be \"0F84\" followed by four ?: making five bytes; not enough. Instead, include more:\n\n$pattern1: 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? (six bytes)\n\nAnother instruction in the trace is FF75... which can form $pattern2.\n\nThus, final patterns:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? }\n$pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n$pattern2 = { FF75 ???? ?? }\n\nBut need to ensure each is exactly six bytes and includes wildcards where applicable.\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they had:\n\n$pattern0: TEST EAX + JZ + MOV → 11 bytes\nSo that's a three-instruction sequence with specific opcodes fixed.\n\nIn our case, perhaps create similar patterns for function calls. For $pattern0: \"E8 F7 25 ?? ????\" (six bytes), but displacement can't be part of the pattern as it's an address.\n\nAlternatively, think of another way to capture the call uniquely.\n\nAfter much consideration, I'll settle on:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8F725???}\nWait, no. Instead, let me define each pattern with six bytes, combining opcode and displacement as ??: \n\nFor $pattern0: Take \"E8 F7 25\" (five bytes) + one ?: total six.\n\nBut wait, that's only five letters plus one ?: six bytes. So:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8F725 ?? }\n\nBut better to represent it accurately. Let me write each as hex with ??: \n\n$pattern0: \"E8 F7 25\" → \"E8F725\", then four more ?: so total of ten bytes, which is over the limit. So need to truncate.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ??? } (six bytes)\n\nSimilarly for $pattern1 and $pattern2.\n\nThus, final corrected rule with three patterns:\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8F725 ?? ?? ?? ?? }  # Six bytes: E8 F7 25 followed by four displacement bytes (??)\n        $pattern1 = { 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }     # Six bytes: 0F 84 followed by four ?? \n        $pattern2 = { FF75 ?? ?? ?? ?? }     # Six bytes: FF 75 followed by four ??\n    \n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
