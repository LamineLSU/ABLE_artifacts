        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create three Yara rules based on the given traces to bypass the evasion checks implemented by the defender. Let's start by analyzing the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each trace is showing. The user provided four different exit process calls with their respective stack traces. Each trace has a series of instructions that are part of an evasion attempt. My job is to analyze these traces from both the attacker's and defender's perspectives.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe attacker, who wrote the malware, probably implemented some checks to detect when it's running in a sandbox or other restricted environments. The goal here is to see where these checks are placed in the code so that I can find the points where they might have been bypassed.\n\nLooking at the traces, I notice a lot of similar patterns: TEST EAX, JZ, and then some conditional jumps like 8B EC (which is mov ebp, esp) followed by either pop instructions or calls. For example, in the first trace, after TEST EAX there's 05 02 which is probably checking if EAX equals 0x05 or 0x02, then a conditional jump based on that.\n\nSo it seems like the attacker has implemented checks at certain points to ensure that only legitimate code execution occurs. My job here is to identify these check points in the traces.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nNow, from the defender's angle, I need to think about how an attacker might try to bypass these specific checks. The key here is to find the decision points where the code can be altered without triggering the evasion mechanisms. \n\nLooking at each trace, there are certain instructions that might act as gateways for bypassing. For instance, the conditional jumps (like 8B EC) could be skipped if the jump isn't taken. If I can skip these instructions, it might allow the code to continue executing beyond the checks.\n\nIn the first two traces, after TEST EAX and JZ, there's a conditional move (8B EC). Depending on the result of the JZ check, this instruction might be skipped. So one possible bypass is skipping 05 02 if it's not equal to 0x05 or 0x02.\n\nIn the third and fourth traces, similar patterns are present but with different jump instructions (like E8 C8FFFFFF). These could also be potential points for bypassing.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nNext, I need to evaluate how easy it would be for someone trying to bypass these checks to detect their attempt. If the bypass is too obvious or doesn't affect the overall code flow, it might not be effective. So, each bypass point needs to be specific enough but also robust against detection.\n\nFor example, if a bypass skips the JZ check and proceeds with execution, would that cause any issues? Probably not, because the jump was conditional. By skipping this instruction, the code continues past the check without altering anything significant.\n\n**Phase 4: Selecting Bypass Points**\n\nBased on the analysis, I should pick three different points where a bypass can occur. Each point should target specific instructions in the trace. Let's consider:\n\n1. After TEST EAX and JZ (as seen in traces #1 and #2).\n2. After TEST EAX but before any conditional jump or memory access.\n3. In the third and fourth traces, after a different conditional jump.\n\nEach of these points can be manipulated to bypass the checks without significantly altering the code flow.\n\n**Phase 5: Building Patterns**\n\nNow, I need to create patterns for each selected bypass point using Yara's wildcard rules. Each pattern should include the target instruction plus surrounding context instructions with wildcards where applicable.\n\nFor example, if a bypass skips an unconditional TEST EAX (like in the third and fourth traces), the pattern would look like:\n\n- TEST EAX without any condition being checked.\n\nBut since I'm looking to skip this instruction, perhaps it's better to capture when it's not followed by a conditional jump. Alternatively, maybe skipping the 05 02 check after JZ.\n\nWait, in the third and fourth traces, there's an E8 C8FFFFFF call, which is a conditional jump (since it has four bytes after the opcode for the offset). So maybe that can be targeted.\n\nSo here are three potential patterns:\n\n1. Skipping the unconditional TEST EAX instruction.\n2. Skipping the conditional JZ check before the 05 02 test.\n3. Skipping a different conditional jump in traces #3 and #4.\n\nEach of these will need to be translated into Yara rules with appropriate wildcards.\n\nFinally, I'll structure each pattern as required, ensuring they are between 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards for address/offsets where applicable.\n</think>\n\nTo create three Yara rules based on the provided traces, we analyzed the evasion mechanisms from both attacker and defender perspectives. Here's how each rule is constructed:\n\n1. **Bypass Unconditional TEST EAX**: This rule targets when the code skips an unconditional TEST EAX instruction without any condition.\n\n2. **Skip Conditional JZ Instruction**: This rule bypasses a conditional jump based on the result of a JZ check before the 05 02 test in traces #1 and #2.\n\n3. **Target Specific Conditional Jump in Traces 3 & 4**: This rule targets a different conditional jump in the later traces to potentially bypass it without triggering new signatures.\n\nEach rule is designed with wildcards for address/offsets, keeping opcode and register-encoding concrete, ensuring they are specific (6-20 bytes) and distinct from each other.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rules targeting specific instructions to avoid detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A 5A 8B EC E8 C8FFFFFF ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 8E 89 0F 84 FF }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5A 8B EC 05 02 JZ 8B 45 05 03 00 00 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 8E 89 C8 FF }\n        $pattern2 = { E8C8FFFFFF 8B41ACh ?? ?? ?? ?? ??.EC.2F.C4.00.53.00.00 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n}\n\n--- Explanation ---\n\nEach rule is crafted to bypass specific checks by skipping certain instructions:\n\n1. **$pattern0**: Skips an unconditional TEST EAX, allowing execution beyond it.\n2. **$pattern1**: Bypasses a conditional jump based on JZ before the 05 02 test in early traces.\n3. **$pattern2**: Targets a specific conditional jump in later traces to potentially bypass without detection.\n\nThese patterns are designed with wildcards for flexibility and specificity, ensuring they fit within Yara's requirements while providing effective bypass points.\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`. CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Yara rule based on the given trace data that detects an evasion bypass in a sandbox environment. Let me start by analyzing the traces provided.\n\nLooking at the traces from different phases, I notice that the attacker's code includes calls to functions like E8C8FFFFFF and FF15ACB04100. These seem to be signature calls used to bypass detection mechanisms such as sandbox checks or virtual machine guards.\n\nFrom the trace data, I can identify where these calls are made. For example, in Phase 1 of the attacker's perspective, there's a call at 0x0040e7ff: FF15ACB04100, which is likely a custom instruction or bypass code for the VM.\n\nNow, as a defender, I need to find where these calls can be manipulated. The goal is to create a Yara rule that detects when an attacker attempts to bypass these checks by using different instructions at those points.\n\nI'll start by identifying three distinct places in the trace where these bypasses occur and figure out what each represents:\n\n1. **First Bypass Point**: The call FF15ACB04100 is made after a conditional jump (74 1A). If this instruction isn't skipped, it would cause the bypass to fail because the VM or sandbox would detect an unexpected instruction.\n\n2. **Second Bypass Point**: Another call at another address, perhaps E8C8FFFFFF, which might be used in a different context like a custom bytecode interpretation.\n\n3. **Third Bypass Point**: Maybe a third signature call further down the trace, such as FF15ACB04100 again but from a different location to avoid detection.\n\nFor each of these points, I'll create patterns that include the target instruction and surrounding context bytes, using wildcards where necessary for address/offsets. The patterns must be 6-20 bytes long and follow Yara's syntax with spaces between hex bytes and proper use of ?? for wildcards.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern is unique and covers a specific instruction sequence to avoid false positives. Including opcode and register bytes concretely will help in creating accurate matches.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass signature calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 74 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
