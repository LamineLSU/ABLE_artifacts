        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help fix this Yara rule because it's not passing the validation. The original task is about creating a bypass rule for evasion. Let me look at what the user provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the error message: \"Missing basic YARA rule structure (rule name, strings, condition)\". That means all three required parts are missing in the rule definition. I remember that Yara rules need a meta section with description and cape_options, a strings section with patterns, and a condition to check any of them.\n\nIn the original attempt, there was no meta or condition sections, so those are definitely missing. The user provided the strings for three patterns but didn't include the necessary meta info, so that's why it failed validation.\n\nNext, I need to generate correct patterns. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long and use wildcards where appropriate. Wildcards are needed for addresses or offsets. For example, in the original patterns, there were raw hex values like C4 which should be replaced with ??.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can see that each call has a similar structure: TEST EAX, then conditional jump (74/75), and then a call to some address. So perhaps each pattern is testing EAX for a condition and then bypassing the call.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 0 is looking for TEST EAX followed by a conditional jump with an offset that's replaced with ???. Then Pattern 1 could be a different instruction sequence, but I'm not sure yet. Wait, the user said to extract exactly three patterns from the trace data, so each should come from the traces.\n\nLooking at the first trace (TRACE #1), there are several calls and conditions. The key is to find sequences where EAX is tested with TEST, then a conditional jump (like 74 or 75) followed by a call. Each pattern can be built around these sequences, using wildcards for any addresses.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be: TEST EAX, conditional jump, and call some address, all in one sequence. Similarly, Patterns 1 and 2 would follow the same structure but from different traces.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and correct. Also, each pattern should include enough context instructions so that when they're skipped, execution doesn't get stuck on other calls.\n\nWait, how are the patterns structured? Each pattern in the strings section represents a sequence of bytes matching an instruction set. So for Pattern 0, it's something like $pattern0 = { [hex bytes] }, which is 6-20 hex values with wildcards where needed.\n\nI should also ensure that each pattern doesn't have any raw addresses or hardcoded offsets; everything that can be a wildcard must be replaced with ??.\n\nLet me think about how to construct the first pattern. From TRACE #1, one of the calls after 74C0 is E825050000, which points to call dword ptr [ebp-00000110h]. So maybe Pattern 0 could be TEST EAX, then a conditional jump with an offset that's replaced with ???. Similarly for the other traces.\n\nWait, but each pattern should come from one of the traces. So for each trace, I can extract a sequence where the bypass is happening, like when the code is skipping the call after a conditional.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be from TRACE #1: TEST EAX (85 C0), then JZ or JE instruction (like 74 ?? followed by the offset as ???), and then a call (E8 ?? ...). Then wrap all of that in wildcards where necessary.\n\nSimilarly, Patterns 1 and 2 can be extracted from other traces. Each should have TEST EAX, a conditional jump with an unknown or variable offset, and a call.\n\nWait, but each pattern needs to be unique. So maybe Pattern 0 is from TRACE #1, Pattern 1 from TRACE #2, and Pattern 2 from TRACE #3 or #4.\n\nI need to make sure that the patterns are different. For example:\n\nPattern 0 could be: $pattern0 = {85 C0 74 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 00 00 E8 ?? ...}\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure about the exact instructions and their bytes.\n\nWait, looking at the user's example in the task, they provided a good example pattern: \"85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\". So that seems like TEST EAX (85 C0), then JZ or JE with offset (74/75 + ???? bytes), and then a call.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be similar to that example but from another part of the trace. But I think each pattern should come directly from the given traces, not just any instruction sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants each pattern to represent a different scenario where the bypass occurs. So in TRACE #1, there's an EAX TEST followed by 74C0 and then a call. Similarly, in other traces, similar sequences exist.\n\nSo I can create Patterns 0, 1, and 2 based on these scenarios, ensuring that each is unique but follows the same structure of TEST EAX, conditional jump, call.\n\nI also need to make sure that all address/offset bytes are replaced with ?? wildcards. For example, in the JZ instruction, if the offset is known (like 85 C0), it can stay as is because it's not an address but a hardcoded value. Wait, no\u2014JZ doesn't have an address; it has an immediate byte. So maybe I'm confusing with other instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps in the original rule, the JZ instruction was being bypassed by skipping it. But since JZ doesn't require an address, there's nothing to wildcard here. However, any following calls would need wildcards for their addresses or offsets.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern includes a call instruction (E8 ?? ??? ...), then that's where the wildcard should be applied.\n\nI think I'm getting confused. Let me try to construct each pattern step by step.\n\nPattern 0: From TRACE #1, perhaps looking at EAX TEST followed by JZ with an offset and a call.\n\nSo:\n\n- TEST EAX (85 C0)\n- JZ (74 ??) where the immediate byte is known but not variable. Wait, in Yara, the JZ instruction takes two bytes: opcode + immediate. So if the immediate can vary, it would be represented as ??? or ?? if it's a 1-byte offset.\n\nBut in this case, maybe the JZ has an unknown immediate? Or perhaps it's fixed (like 85 C0). I'm not sure from the given trace data.\n\nWait, looking at the user's example pattern: \"85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\", which seems to be TEST EAX, JZ with an unknown offset (??), and then a call with some address.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 0 is:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nPattern 1 could come from another trace, like TRACE #2, where again there's an EAX TEST followed by a JZ or JE with unknown offset and then a call.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n$pattern1 = { 85 C0 74 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ... }\n\nBut I'm not sure exactly. Alternatively, each pattern could be from the same trace but different instructions leading to the exit.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern is built around a specific call instruction that's being bypassed by skipping JZ or JE before it.\n\nSo in TRACE #1, there are two calls after JZ: E825050000 and E874FAFFFF. So Pattern 0 could be the sequence from TEST EAX to the first call, with JZ skipped.\n\nSimilarly, Patterns 1 and 2 can come from other traces.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to define each pattern as a unique instruction sequence that includes TEST EAX, a conditional jump (with unknown offset), and then a call to an address.\n\nEach pattern will have:\n\n- 85 C0 (TEST EAX)\n- OP (JZ or JE) followed by ???? (if immediate is variable)\n- Then the next instruction after JZ, which is likely a call with some address, so that part would be ??...\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about how to structure each pattern. Maybe it's better to create three patterns, each focusing on different calls in the traces.\n\nWait, maybe Pattern 0 is for the first call (E825050000) and Pattern 1 for the second (E874FAFFFF). But I'm not sure how to translate that into hex patterns with wildcards.\n\nAlternatively, each pattern could be a specific instruction set before the call. For example:\n\nPattern 0: TEST EAX, JZ, then call dword ptr [...]\nPattern 1: TEST EAX, JE (or another conditional), then call ...\nPattern 2: TEST EAX, JZ with different offset, then call ...\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on how to exactly translate this into hex and wildcards.\n\nLet me try constructing Pattern 0 as follows:\n\n- Start with TEST EAX: 85 C0\n- Then a conditional jump (JZ or JE): let's say it's 74 ?? since the offset is unknown. So 74 followed by ????\n- Then, after JZ, there's a call to some address. For example, E825050000 which would be replaced with ??.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 00 00 E8 ?? ... }\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact bytes after JZ. Maybe it's better to have each pattern include a few more instructions to make them unique.\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided by the user:\n\nGood Example: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (11 bytes)\n\nSo that seems like TEST EAX, JZ with unknown offset, then a call. So maybe Pattern 0 is similar but includes more instructions to reach the call.\n\nBut I think each pattern should be around 6-20 bytes and include context so that when they're skipped, execution continues correctly.\n\nPerhaps Pattern 0 could be:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ... }\n\nWait, but in the given trace data, each JZ is followed by a call. So maybe each pattern represents the entire sequence from TEST EAX to the bypassed call.\n\nBut I'm still not exactly sure how to structure these patterns correctly. Maybe it's better to base each pattern on one of the calls and include all leading instructions up to that point with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI think I've spent enough time trying to figure this out, but perhaps I should outline each pattern as follows:\n\nPattern 0: TEST EAX (85 C0), then JZ/ JE instruction (74 or 75 followed by ???), then a call (E8 ?? ...), and include any necessary surrounding instructions with wildcards.\n\nSimilarly for Patterns 1 and 2, using different traces to extract their specific sequences.\n\nSo the final corrected rule would have three patterns, each matching specific bypass scenarios from the traces, using wildcards where address/offsets are present, ensuring each pattern is unique and exactly 6-20 bytes long.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task of correcting the Yara rule for detecting evasion bypass, I've analyzed the provided trace data to extract patterns that match typical bypass attempts. Each pattern should be specific enough to identify a target location while being general enough to match multiple scenarios.\n\nThe corrected rule now includes three distinct patterns (each 6-20 bytes long) with wildcards where necessary and ensures the meta information is correctly formatted.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ??

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the YARA rule based on the provided information. The user has given a previous attempt that failed validation because it didn't meet all the requirements. Let me break down what's needed.\n\nFirst, the original rule had three patterns, but they were missing wildcards where necessary and didn't include the `cape_options` correctly. The validation errors pointed out these issues, so I need to address them.\n\nThe user provided trace data from a sandbox execution. Each trace has several instructions that could be part of an evasion bypass. My task is to analyze these traces, identify potential bypass points, create patterns with wildcards for addresses and offsets, and ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long.\n\nLooking at the traces, I notice that there are multiple `E8` calls in different traces. For example, in TRACE #1 and #2, there's an `E825050000` call. In TRACE #3 and #4, there's an `E8C8FFFFFF` call. These could be potential bypass points if they're skipped.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns. Let me consider each trace:\n\n1. From TRACE #1: The instruction before the call is `8B EC`, which is a mov operation.\n2. From TRACE #2: Similar structure, maybe around `8B EC` again.\n3. From TRACE #3 and #4: The instruction is `E8C8FFFFFF`, which seems unique.\n\nWait, but I need three different patterns. Let me think of each pattern as capturing a different call instruction with surrounding context.\n\nFor the first pattern, let's take the call at the end of TRACE #1: `E825050000` followed by some operations. But looking closer, maybe it's better to capture the call and preceding context in one pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each trace contributes a different bypass point. For example:\n\n- Pattern 1 could be around the first `E825050000` call with surrounding instructions.\n- Pattern 2 from another part of TRACE #2 or another trace.\n- Pattern 3 from the unique `E8C8FFFFFF` call.\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern is distinct and covers different parts of the traces. Also, each pattern should include wildcards for addresses and offsets.\n\nLet me try constructing each pattern:\n\nPattern 0: Capture a call instruction with some preceding and following bytes, including wildcards.\n- Maybe `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` followed by other instructions that are skipped.\n\nPattern 1: Another distinct call from a different trace or part of the traces.\n- Perhaps another `E8` call structure with wildcards.\n\nPattern 2: The unique `E8C8FFFFFF` call, which could be one pattern on its own.\n\nI also need to include the `cape_options` in the meta section. This includes `bp0`, `bp1`, and `bp2`, each pointing to their respective patterns plus zero bytes since they're 6-20 bytes long.\n\nNow, I'll format each pattern with hex bytes, ensuring address/offsets are replaced with `??`. Also, make sure all opcodes and register encodings are kept concrete.\n\nLet me draft the corrected rule now.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific call instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B EC 05 00 00 E8C8FFFFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

The user has already analyzed the traces and generated some hypotheses about potential bypass instructions.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, there are four traces where the program exits after certain calls. In each case, before the exit call, there's a test instruction (85C0) followed by a conditional jump or similar. \n\nIn the first two traces, the test is followed by a JZ or JE with some condition that allows the bypass. So I can extract patterns from these sections.\n\nLooking at the third and fourth traces, they don't have a test before the exit call but do have a push operation (8BEC) which might be part of the context needed for the pattern.\n\nI'll need to create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. One that includes 85C0 followed by JZ or JE with some conditions.\n2. Another from the third trace, maybe involving the push and then the test before exit.\n3. The third pattern could come from the fourth trace, capturing the relevant instructions.\n\nI'll replace all address/offset bytes with ?? to meet the wildcard requirement. Also, ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes.\n\nLet me draft each pattern:\n\nPattern 1: Combine 85C0 with JZ conditions and include surrounding context.\nPattern 2: From trace #3, include push before test.\nPattern 3: From trace #4, capture the relevant section including any pushes or pops.\n\nI need to make sure they're all different and each is exactly 6-20 bytes. Also, in the meta section, add the cape_options with the correct format.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting test jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 E8 ?? ??.??.??.??. 74 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 75 08 E8 C8 ???? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
