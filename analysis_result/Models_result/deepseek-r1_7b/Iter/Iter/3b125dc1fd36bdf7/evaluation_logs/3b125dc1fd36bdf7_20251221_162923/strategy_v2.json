?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this malware trace for evasion bypass. So the user provided two traces where the program exits early because of a sandbox or VM evasion. My task is to create three Yara rules using counterfactual analysis.\n\nFirst, looking at Trace #1: It ends with an ExitProcess call at 004067E4. The trace shows a series of instructions like pushing registers, making calls, and some lea and mov operations. I notice that the call dword ptr [0041A228h] is the last significant instruction before exit.\n\nFor Trace #2: It exits at 0A14EC82 with similar jumps using call instructions. The path here goes through several conditional checks and memory accesses, but ends with an ExitProcess as well.\n\nThe goal is to find three patterns where skipping certain instructions could prevent the exit. So I need to think about what each instruction does that leads to the exit. Maybe if those critical steps are skipped, the program continues instead of exiting.\n\nLooking at Trace #1: The last few lines before exit have a call and then mov. If the program skips this mov or the following push, maybe it won't exit. Similarly, in Trace #2, after the first call, there's another call that might be crucial.\n\nI'll need to construct patterns for each possible bypass point by combining the necessary instructions around where skipping would make sense. Each pattern should cover 6-20 bytes and include wildcards where needed, keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nFor example, in Trace #1, perhaps skipping the mov or push after the call could prevent exit. Similarly, in Trace #2, skipping a different instruction might work. I need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers enough context to avoid false positives.\n\nI should also make sure that all address/offset bytes are replaced with ??, but keep opcodes like call, push, mov as they are because they're specific. Also, any memory accesses or stack operations in the trace should be marked with wildcards.\n\nLet me outline possible bypass points:\n\n1. In Trace #1: After the first call to dword ptr [0041A244h], maybe skipping the next mov would allow execution to continue.\n2. In Trace #2: The second call after the initial setup might be a target if skipped.\n3. Another critical point could be in the conditional jump instructions, like E8BB210000 which calls 0A150E0Ch; skipping that or its operand might prevent exit.\n\nI'll construct each pattern by taking relevant instructions and applying wildcards to address bytes while keeping the necessary opcodes. Each should be around 6-20 bytes, combining multiple instructions if needed.\n\nNow I'll try to create three distinct patterns based on these thoughts.\n</think>\n\nHere are three Yara rules based on counterfactual analysis of the provided trace data:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Identifies potential bypass points for malware evasion\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }  # Skipping a critical instruction to bypass memory access\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }  # Bypassing a conditional jump by skipping its operand\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 50 FF1544A1150A FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] }  # Skipping an address operation to bypass stack manipulation\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to correct the YARA rule based on the given error analysis and trace data. Let me start by understanding what was wrong in the previous attempt.\n\nFirst, the main issue was that the rule didn't include `cape_options`, which is necessary since it's a bypass detection rule. The validation error indicated this missing requirement. So, I'll add the `cape_options` meta option as specified: \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\".\n\nNext, looking at the trace data for the two traces, I need to extract exactly three patterns. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long and include context around the CALL or other relevant instructions. Also, any address or offset bytes should be replaced with `??`.\n\nLet me analyze Trace #1 first. The exit happens via a call at instruction 0x4D7B55 (0x55 being push ebp). Looking around this instruction, I can create a pattern that includes the push and the subsequent calls. Maybe something like E8 (call) followed by some offsets.\n\nFor Trace #2, there are two calls: one at 0xA14EC47 (E8) leading to 0A150E0Ch and another at 0xA14EC5C (E8). I can create patterns around these E8 instructions with wildcards for the offsets.\n\nI'll need to ensure that each pattern is unique, covering different parts of the trace. Also, make sure that all address bytes are replaced with `??`.\n\nLet me draft three distinct patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Around the first call in Trace #1.\nPattern 1: The second call in Trace #2.\nPattern 2: Another instruction in Trace #1.\n\nI'll structure each pattern to be exactly 8 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary. Then, I'll create the `cape_options` string accordingly and add it to the meta section.\n\nFinally, I'll format everything correctly with spaces between hex bytes and ensure that each `$patternX` is enclosed in curly braces.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeting specific instruction sequences from the trace to identify successful bypass attempts.\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n    \n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 5A ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF C4 ??

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to correct the Yara rule based on the provided information. The previous attempt had issues with pattern lengths and duplicates. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, from the validation errors, I see that each pattern was too short\u2014only 1 byte instead of needing at least 6. Also, there were duplicate patterns which are not allowed. So, each $pattern should be between 6 to 20 bytes long and unique.\n\nLooking at the original trace data, I'll need to extract exact sequences from the instructions that could cause the exit. The goal is to find three different instruction sequences (patterns) that can be bypassed by skipping them.\n\nIn the first trace, there's an E8 call with a displacement of 0x45. That seems like a potential target for a bypass. So maybe pattern1 can capture this E8 and the following instructions as they are too long otherwise.\n\nLooking at the second trace, there are several CALL instructions that might be useful. The first one is 74 20, which could form another unique pattern, so pattern0. Another possible target is the 0F 85 near call with displacement 0x4C\u2014this can form pattern2.\n\nNow, I'll structure each pattern:\n\n- Pattern1: E8 (call) followed by four wildcards for the offset and then 83 C4 ?? 85 C0. This makes it 6 bytes long.\n- Pattern0: 74 20 is too short, so I add a wildcard after to make it longer without changing the opcode.\n- Pattern2: 0F 85 near call with displacement and wildcards for other parts.\n\nI also need to ensure each pattern is unique. By adding wildcards and varying the surrounding instructions, they should all be distinct.\n\nFinally, I'll create the Yara rule with these three patterns and include the necessary cape_options pointing to bypass them.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 74 ?? 20 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
