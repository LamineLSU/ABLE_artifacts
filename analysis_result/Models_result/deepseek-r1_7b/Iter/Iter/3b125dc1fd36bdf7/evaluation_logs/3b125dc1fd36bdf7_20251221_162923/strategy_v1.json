and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n7. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user analyze malware evasion by creating Yara rules based on provided trace data. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user has given two traces where the exit process happens at different points. The goal is to find bypass patterns that could cause the execution to terminate early. \n\nFirst, I'll look for suspicious instructions in both traces. In Trace #1, I see a lot of sub esp and push instructions followed by calls. There's a call to dword ptr [0041A0BCh] which might be a target. Then there are some lea and push operations. The exit happens at 004067E4 with another call.\n\nIn Trace #2, the exit is at 0A14EC82. The instructions include conditional jumps like JE and JNZ, TEST and CMP commands, and several calls. This suggests a more complex control flow.\n\nNext, I need to identify possible bypass candidates by tracing backward from the exit point. For each trace, I'll see what leads up to the exit and consider which instructions could be skipped or bypassed for evasion.\n\nIn Trace #1, the exit is caused by FF1528A24100 calling dword ptr [0041A228h]. Before that, at 004067CD, there's a push of 00000000h. Maybe this is a target for bypass. Then earlier, there are two calls to dword ptr [0041A0BCh], which could be points where the code jumps.\n\nIn Trace #2, the exit happens after several function calls: FF156CA1150A at 0A14EC82. The path leads through a jump and a compare. Maybe bypassing the conditional jumps or the test instructions could help.\n\nNow, I need to create patterns for each of these candidates. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, include the target instruction and surrounding context, use wildcards where applicable, and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nFor the first candidate in Trace #1, maybe the push at 004067CD is a target. The pattern would include that push followed by the calls and then the exit call. But I need to make sure it's specific enough with wildcards.\n\nIn Trace #2, perhaps bypassing the TEST EAX or the conditional jumps like JZ could be candidates. Their surrounding instructions can form patterns when combined.\n\nI should ensure each pattern is unique and covers different instruction sequences so that they don't overlap in Yara rules. Also, I need to make sure that all address/offsets are replaced with ?? as per the wildcard rules.\n\nFinally, structure these into three separate patterns, each 6-20 bytes long, formatted correctly with wildcards and opcode-register combinations.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 56 8BEC FF15BCA04100 8365E400 E847000000 BA3C004200 B900004200 }\n        $pattern1 = { 0A14EC47 55 FF15BCA04100 83F801 7420 C1E8 08 A801 FF7508 50 FF1514A1150A }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A 5A E8BB210000 7420 C1E8 08 A801 FF7508 50 FF1518A1150A FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help create an improved Yara bypass rule based on the feedback we got earlier. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the history, the initial attempt resulted in a rule hit but no new signatures. That suggests that whatever pattern was used matched, but it wasn't effective enough or maybe matching the wrong place in the trace. The latest analysis mentioned that we should focus on earlier parts of the trace where the decision is made before exiting.\n\nFrom the provided traces, I see two main exit processes: one at 004067E4 and another at 0A14EC82. Each has a series of instructions leading up to the call that triggers the exit. \n\nLooking at Strategy A first, which focuses on the first 30% of the trace with a pattern involving CALL, TEST EAX, and JE/JNE. This seems promising because it targets the check before exiting, making it less likely for anti-evaders to catch on.\n\nIn the first trace, after the initial setup (push ebp, mov esp, sub esp), there's a call dword ptr [0041A0BCh], which is a test+je pattern. So maybe capturing this sequence would work. I need to make sure to use exact hex values from the trace for specificity.\n\nThe second trace has more steps before the exit, but it also involves a similar check around EAX manipulation and conditional jumps. Maybe another pattern here could be effective.\n\nFor Strategy B, which is about checking decisions before exiting, perhaps capturing a conditional instruction right before the exit call would help. For example, looking for cmp eax, imm followed by a jump based on that comparison.\n\nI should also consider that all patterns must come from the original trace and use exact hex values with wildcards where necessary. I'll need to extract specific instructions from each trace to form these patterns.\n\nLet me outline possible patterns:\n\n1. From the first exit (004067E4), after pushing ebp, mov esp, sub esp, there's a call dword ptr [0041A0BCh]. This likely does a test on EAX and jumps if not equal. So the pattern could be 8BEC (push ebp), 83EC48 (sub esp,48h), then 56 (push esi), FF15BCA04100 (call dword ptr [0041A0BCh]), and maybe the test and jump. Wait, but I need to capture the exact sequence before the call.\n\n2. Another pattern could be looking for a conditional check in the second exit trace at 0A14EC82, where after some setup, there's a test on EAX with a comparison and then a conditional jump. So maybe after pushing ebp and moving things around, it does 83F801 (cmp eax, 01h), jne, etc.\n\n3. For the third pattern, perhaps looking at specific instruction sequences that are unique to each exit point but still related to decision-making before exiting. Maybe a RDTSC timing or another CPUID-related check.\n\nEach of these needs to be extracted from the exact trace data provided. I'll make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards where necessary for address offsets, like in the call dword ptr locations.\n\nAlso, ensuring that each pattern is specific enough to hit the intended target without being too broad. Using exact hex values will help match only at the right place in the trace.\n\nI should also remember to structure the Yara rule correctly with meta: description, strings for the patterns, and the cape_options referencing these patterns.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe previous attempt resulted in a rule hit without new signatures, suggesting the pattern matched but didn't target the correct decision point. By focusing on earlier trace sections where exit decisions are made (Strategy A), we can create more specific bypass patterns.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ  \n**REASONING:** Targeting instruction sequences immediately before exits to avoid detection.\n\n**PATTERN EXAMPLES:**\n1. `{ 8BEC, 83EC48, 56 }` (from first exit)\n2. `{ 83F801, 7412, 8B4068 }` (from second exit)\n3. `{ 85C00F84, 8B45FC }`  \n\n**YARA_RULE:**  \n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting decision points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BEC, 83EC48, 56 }\n        $pattern1 = { 83F801, 7412, 8B4068 }\n        $pattern2 = { 85C00F84, 8B45FC }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this YARA bypass rule evolution task step by step. I'm new to this, so bear with me as I try to figure out the best approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided a bunch of trace data and some initial attempts at creating a Yara rule. The goal is to create an improved bypass rule based on feedback from previous attempts. \n\nLooking back at the history, they tried two iterations where the rule hit but didn't find new signatures. So, I need to adjust their patterns or maybe change strategies.\n\nThe original traces show two exit processes: one at 004067E4 and another at 0A14EC82. Each has a series of instructions leading up to the call. \n\nFrom the key principles, strategy A is trying an evasion check in the first 30% of the trace, which involves a test and jump instruction (JE/JNE). Strategy B looks for exit decisions before the actual exit call. Strategy C uses specific techniques like timing or detection.\n\nSince their previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, maybe their initial patterns were too broad or matched the wrong place. I need to make sure the new patterns are more specific but still present in the traces.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nFor TRACE #1:\n- The first few instructions after the push include a test on EAX (8BEC) and then a call. Maybe pattern A is looking for this sequence.\nBut since it failed before, perhaps I need to adjust where or how the pattern is matched.\n\nForTRACE #2:\n- It starts with a mov into EDI, followed by a jump based on EAX's value. This could be a good candidate for strategy B because it's an exit decision point.\n\nI should create three different patterns that target these strategic points without being too broad. Let me think of specific instruction sequences from the traces:\n\n1. The first 30% of the trace includes a test on EAX (8BEC) followed by a call or jump.\n   Pattern: { 0A4C7E, 55, 00000000, FF15BCA04100, ... } Maybe something like TEST EAX, then call.\n\n2. Another point is the conditional check before the exit calls in TRACE #2.\n   Pattern: { C85C, 8BEC, mov, conditional jump }\n\n3. The third pattern could be specific to another part of the trace, maybe involving a shr or test instruction leading up to an exit.\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards for address/offsets where necessary. Also, all patterns must come directly from the traces without adding new hex values.\n\nLet me extract specific sequences:\n\nFrom TRACE #1:\n- After the first push, we have EAX tested (8BEC), then a call via dword ptr [0041A0BCh]. Maybe 6 bytes: 8B EC 55 FF15 BC A0 BCh? Wait, no, it's more like TEST EAX followed by a call.\n\nBut TEST EAX is 3 bytes (8BEA C). Then the call is another instruction. Hmm.\n\nMaybe Pattern 1 can be {8BEA, C, 55, FF15BCA04100}. But that might be too long or not exact.\n\nFrom TRACE #2:\n- Before the exit calls, there's a mov into EAX and then a conditional jump (7510). So maybe Pattern 2 is {C85C, 8BEC, C1E8, 7510}.\n\nFor another pattern, let's look at the shr instruction in TRACE #2: A801. Maybe that can be part of a different exit decision or bypass point.\n\nAlternatively, there's an shr on EAX (A801), followed by a test and jne. So maybe Pattern 3 is {A801, 7510}.\n\nWait, but each pattern should be in the trace data without adding new values. Let me check:\n\nLooking at TRACE #2:\n- After the mov, there's a shr (A801), then test al and jne (7510). So maybe Pattern 3 is {A801, 74 7510}.\n\nBut I need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes. Also, using wildcards for addresses where possible.\n\nWait, in the trace, all calls are via [0041A0BCh] or similar, so maybe Pattern 1 can be something like {8BEA C55 FF15BCA04100} but that's too short. Or include more bytes to make it specific.\n\nAlternatively, use a sequence from the first part of TRACE #2: {C85C 8BEC C1E8 7510} which is 6 bytes (including all hex values).\n\nAnother approach could be using the shr instruction in TRACE #2 as a bypass point. So maybe Pattern 3 is {A801, ...}.\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern uses exact hex values from the trace without adding new ones. Let me list possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1: TEST EAX followed by a call (from TRACE #1)\n- Instructions: 8BEA C55 FF15BCA04100 \u2192 which is 3 + 2 bytes? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use the first few instructions after the initial push. Maybe {8BEC 55 FF15BCA04100} as a test and call sequence.\n\nPattern 2: Conditional jump based on EAX (from TRACE #2)\n- Instructions: C85C 8BEC C1E8 7510 \u2192 this is specific to the conditional check in the second trace.\n\nPattern 3: Another bypass point, perhaps after shr instruction\n- Maybe {A801 74 7510} as shr followed by jne.\n\nWait, but I need each pattern to be a continuous sequence of instructions from the trace. Let me see:\n\nIn TRACE #2:\n- After the mov (C85C), we have EAX tested and a conditional jump: {C85C 8BEC C1E8 7510}.\n\nSo Pattern 2 can be that exact sequence: 4 instructions, so hex values: C85C, 8BEC, C1E8, 7510 \u2192 which is four bytes? Wait no, each instruction has multiple hex bytes. Maybe it's better to represent as a continuous block.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern should be represented by the exact bytes from the trace without wildcards unless necessary. But since I'm supposed to use wildcards for address/offsets where needed, maybe some patterns can have ?? in offsets.\n\nBut given that all hex values are present in the traces, I might not need any wildcards here. So each pattern would be a specific sequence of instructions taken directly from the trace data.\n\nSo Pattern 1: From TRACE #1's first part:\n- TEST EAX (8BEA C), then call (FF15BCA04100). So maybe {8BEC, 55, FF15BCA04100} but that would be 3 instructions. To make it a pattern, perhaps include the next few bytes.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm limited to 6-20 bytes and each instruction is multiple hex values, I might have to capture more bytes from the trace.\n\nWait, maybe I can represent each pattern as a specific instruction sequence:\n\nPattern 1: TEST EAX (8BEA C), then the call via [0041A0BCh]. So exact sequence would be {8BEC55FF15BCA04100}, but that's too long.\n\nAlternatively, take just the necessary bytes for a match. For example, 6 bytes: 8B EC C5 FF15 BCA0 \u2192 which might not cover the whole instruction.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for distinct sequences in the traces and create three unique patterns based on them.\n\nIn TRACE #2, after the initial mov (C85C), there's a conditional jump (7510) based on EAX. That seems like a good target for an exit decision bypass.\n\nSo Pattern 2: {C85C, 8BEC, C1E8, 7510} \u2192 this is four bytes in terms of instructions but each instruction has multiple hex values.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the pattern as specific lines from the trace. For example:\n\nPattern 1:\n- Line 3: TEST EAX (8BEA)\n- Line 4: call [0041A0BCh] (FF15BCA0)\n\nSo Pattern 1 could be {8BEC, 55, FF15BCA0} which is three instructions.\n\nPattern 2:\n- Line 3 of TRACE #2: C85C\n- Then line 4: 8BEC\n- Line 5: C1E8\n- Line 6: 7510\n\nSo Pattern 2 would be {C85C, 8BEC, C1E8, 7510}\n\nPattern 3:\nLooking at another point in the trace, maybe after the shr instruction (A801) and before the jne:\n\n- Line 6: A801\n- Line 7: 742F (test)\n- Line 8: 7510\n\nSo Pattern 3 would be {A801, 742F, 7510}\n\nI think this covers three distinct patterns:\n\n1. TEST EAX followed by a call in TRACE #1.\n2. Conditional jump based on EAX in TRACE #2.\n3. shr instruction with test and jne in another part of TRACE #2.\n\nEach pattern is specific to the trace data without adding new hex values, so they should work better than previous attempts that didn't find new signatures. By targeting these strategic points before the exit calls, the bypass rule might be more effective as it's trying to match known evasive tactics used in the traces.\n</think>\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved using specific sequences from trace analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [0A4C7E, 55, FF15BCA04100] }\n        $pattern1 = { [C85C, 8BEC, C1E8, 7510] }\n        $pattern2 = { [A801, 742F, 7510] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
