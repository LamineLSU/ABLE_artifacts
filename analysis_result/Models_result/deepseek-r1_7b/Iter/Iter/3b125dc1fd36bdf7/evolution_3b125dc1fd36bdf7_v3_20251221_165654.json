The previous attempt failed because it didn't meet all the validation requirements.\n\nFirst, looking at the error analysis: missing basic structure, which includes a valid YARA rule template with meta section and strings for each pattern. The user's previous rule was invalid because it lacked these components.\n\nThe task is to generate a corrected rule with three different patterns, each 6-20 bytes long. Each pattern should include wildcards for address/offset bytes and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nFrom the trace data provided, I can extract specific instruction sequences that represent potential bypass points. The goal is to create three unique patterns based on different instructions in the traces.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, there's a call to dword ptr [0041A0C0h] (E84700) and another to 0041A0C8h (E848). Also, there are multiple pushes and pops on the stack. Maybe I can create patterns around these calls.\n\nIn TRACE #2, there's a call to [0A150E0Ch] (E8BB2100) and several mov instructions with varying displacements, like 6430h. This could help form another pattern.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is exactly six to twenty bytes long by combining consecutive instructions and using wildcards where applicable.\n\nLet me start crafting the patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Around E84700 in TRACE #1. Maybe include E8, some ?? for offsets, then more instructions like F5, 28h (??), etc.\nPattern 1: From E8BB2100 in TRACE #2, including calls and movs with ?? wildcards.\nPattern 2: Around the mov instruction with displacement 6430h.\n\nI'll check each pattern to ensure they are unique and meet the length requirement. Also, I'll make sure all address bytes are replaced with ?? as per wildcard rules.\n\nFinally, I'll structure them in YARA format with the correct meta section and strings for each pattern.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific instructions to avoid detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 ??.

My goal is to analyze the mistakes and generate a correct rule.\n\nFirst, I'll review the original invalid rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=trace,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n             // Targeting a call instruction with an offset\n        }\n        $pattern1 = { 75 0C ?? ?? ??\n             // Targeting a conditional jmp near\n        }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 45 ?? ?? ??\n             // Targeting a stack push with displacement\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThe main issues highlighted are missing basic Yara structure and incorrect `cape_options`. The task is to ensure the rule has exactly three patterns, each between 6-20 bytes, uses wildcards for address/offsets, includes correct opcode and register encodings, and has valid syntax.\n\nLooking at the error analysis:\n\n1. **Missing Basic Structure**: The rule lacks braces in `cape_options` which might be causing syntax issues.\n2. **Wildcards Usage**: The patterns don't replace all addresses with `??`.\n3. **Cape Options Incorrect**: The current option for `$pattern1` is set to 'trace', which isn't valid.\n\nI'll start by extracting three distinct patterns from the provided trace data, ensuring each meets the 6-20 byte requirement and uses wildcards appropriately.\n\nFrom the first trace, I notice instructions like `8B EC`, `E8`, `83 C4`, etc. These can form parts of my patterns. Similarly, the second trace has `75 0C`, `E8`, which are good candidates.\n\nLet's construct each pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern for E8 (call instruction)**:\n   - Targeting an instruction with a displacement.\n   - Example: `{ E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }` covers `E8` plus four wildcard bytes to replace the offset.\n\n2. **Pattern for 75 0C (conditional jmp near)**:\n   - Combine the conditional jump and nearby instruction.\n   - Example: `{ 75 0C ?? ?? ?? ?? }` with wildcards covering any displacement.\n\n3. **Pattern for 8B 45 (stack push with displacement)**:\n   - Include the stack operation and its displacement.\n   - Example: `{ 8B 45 ?? ?? ?? ?? }` to capture various displacements.\n\nNext, I'll ensure each pattern is unique and includes different sequences from the trace. This will help in bypassing detection more effectively.\n\nNow, constructing the `cape_options` section:\n\n- Each pattern (bp0, bp1, bp2) should reference their respective patterns with action 'skip' except for one which might be needed to bypass a specific check.\n- The count is set to 0 as per requirement.\n\nFinally, I'll validate that all address bytes are replaced with `??` and that opcode and register encodings are kept concrete. This ensures the Yara rule accurately matches the intended evasive behaviors without including any unnecessary information.\n\nAfter assembling everything, I'll format it correctly, ensuring each pattern is within 6-20 bytes, uses wildcards appropriately, and follows Yara's syntax rules.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? 3C ?A ?D ?B } // Targeting a call instruction with an offset\n        $pattern1 = { 75 0C 8A ?? ?? ?? } // Targeting a conditional jmp near\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 45 ?? ?? 9E 0F } // Targeting a stack push with displacement\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
