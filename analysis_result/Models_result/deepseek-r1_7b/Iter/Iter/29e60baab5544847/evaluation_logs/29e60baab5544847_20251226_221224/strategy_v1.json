do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help analyze this malware evasion trace data. The user provided five different traces from an analysis of a sandbox or VM, each showing the call sequence leading to the exit process. My task is to figure out possible bypass methods used and create YARA rules for them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these traces represent. Each trace starts with the address where ExitProcess was called and then shows the instructions that led up to it. Looking at the first trace, for example, it starts with a series of push operations on ebp, some calls, and finally exits. The same pattern is somewhat repeated in other traces but with slight differences.\n\nI remember that malware evasion often involves bypassing security measures like stack canopies or memory checks. Common techniques include using different instruction sequences to achieve the same result, which can confuse analysis tools. So I should look for variations in the instructions leading up to the exit point.\n\nLooking at the first trace (TRACE #1), I see a lot of TEST EAX and JZ instructions mixed with calls like E8250500h. Wait, that's probably an address constant used in a call instruction. The same pattern is present in other traces but with varying constants.\n\nIn the second trace (TRACE #2), similar TEST and JZ are used, but there are different labels before the exit. Maybe the label changes cause different paths? Hmm, not sure if labels affect bypass directly, but it might indicate a different function was called after some operations.\n\nThe third and fourth traces have slightly altered addresses in their calls compared to the first two. For example, instead of 0125E3 or something similar, they use 0126A9h or others. This suggests that the same type of call is made but with a different offset\u2014this could indicate that the code was modified by replacing one constant with another.\n\nThen there's the fifth trace (TRACE #5), which looks very different from the first four. It has more complex jumps, like checking the AL register and then making a call based on that result. The exit path is longer here, so it might have multiple conditions leading to the exit.\n\nI need to figure out what instructions are causing the bypass. Let's start by looking for the exit point in each trace. All traces end with ExitProcess at certain addresses, but before that, there are conditional jumps and calls.\n\nIn the first four traces, after some operations, they call a function labeled C3 or something similar, then proceed to push some values onto the stack, maybe using EAX and EBX registers, and finally exit. The fifth trace has more steps, like checking AL and making dynamic decisions.\n\nFor creating YARA rules, I need to find patterns that could bypass these security mechanisms. The idea is to look for instruction sequences that can cause the same effect as the original code but in a way that's harder to detect.\n\nLooking at the first four traces, there are multiple TEST EAX instructions followed by JZ or JE jumps. For example:\n\n- TEST EAX, then JZ (or JE) based on whether EAX is zero.\n- Then some operations like adding EBX to EAX and pushing values onto the stack.\n\nThese could be replaced with different sequences that achieve the same result but using different instructions. Maybe using BL instead of TEST followed by conditional jumps? Or perhaps moving bytes around differently?\n\nWait, in the fifth trace, there's a test on AL before making a call. So if the code checks for AL being zero or one and then calls a function based on that, maybe bypassing that would require changing both the condition and what it leads to.\n\nSo possible bypass candidates could be:\n\n1. Replacing TEST EAX with BL EAX (since BL is a branch instruction and might not leave the same trace).\n2. Changing the JZ or JE conditions\u2014maybe using different byte orders or operations.\n3. Using different ways to check AL, like using XOR on AL instead of just comparing it.\n\nEach of these could create distinct patterns in the trace that bypass the original security checks.\n\nLet me try to outline possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1: Replace TEST EAX with BL EAX (this might remove the stack check and bypass a memory restriction)\nPattern 2: Change the condition from JZ to something else, maybe using AND or OR operations.\nPattern 3: Instead of checking AL for zero, use XOR on AL.\n\nEach pattern would need to be combined with surrounding instructions to form a specific enough rule that YARA can match. For example, combining two TEST and one JZ into a sequence that bypasses the check.\n\nWait, but in the fifth trace, it's not just about changing conditions; it's also using different labels which might point to different code paths. So perhaps the fifth trace uses dynamic jumps (like JNZ based on AL) instead of fixed jumps, making it harder for static analysis tools to catch.\n\nSo another possible pattern is to have a sequence like TEST AL followed by XOR and then a conditional jump that's not predictable without knowing the original code path.\n\nI think I need to extract specific instruction sequences from these traces that could potentially bypass the security checks. Each of these will form a YARA rule when combined with wildcards for addresses and offsets, keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nSo summarizing my thoughts:\n\n1. Replace TEST EAX with BL EAX in some instructions.\n2. Change conditional jumps (JZ to different conditions) or add extra steps before the jump.\n3. Use dynamic jumps based on register values instead of fixed ones.\n\nEach of these will create a unique pattern that can be turned into a YARA rule, allowing detection of this specific bypass method without revealing the original code's path.\n</think>\n\nTo address the malware evasion analysis, I have identified three distinct instruction sequences (patterns) from the traces that could potentially bypass security measures. Each pattern is designed to mimic the original behavior while using different instructions for bypassing.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Instruction Sequences Leading to Exit:**\n   - Reviewed each trace to locate TEST, JZ/JE, and CALL instructions before the exit.\n   \n2. **Determine Bypass Candidates:**\n   - Replaced TEST EAX with BL EAX in some cases.\n   - Changed conditional jumps (JZ) to different conditions or added extra operations.\n   - Used dynamic jumps based on register values instead of fixed ones.\n\n3. **Create Patterns from Identified Sequences:**\n   - Combined 2-3 consecutive instructions into patterns, ensuring they cover the bypass method effectively.\n\n4. **Apply Wildcards and Generate YARA Rules:**\n   - Replaced address/offset bytes with `??`.\n   - Kept opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n   - Formed specific rules for each pattern.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting stack canopies and memory checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85C0 0F84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ?? }   # TEST EAX followed by conditional jump\n        $pattern1 = { 6A5B 5A 8BCE E8250500 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8D95F0FE ?? }   # Modified call and test sequence\n        $pattern2 = { 6A40 FF7508 8B40E130h C3 ?? ?? ?? ??

do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the YARA rule based on the given trace data and the previous invalid attempt. Let me start by understanding what was wrong in the last attempt.\n\nIn the previous rule, the user had three patterns, but they were either too short or didn't meet all the requirements. The validation errors mentioned issues like missing basic YARA structure, incorrect string definitions, and incorrect pattern lengths. So, I need to make sure each part of the new rule adheres strictly to Yara's specifications.\n\nFirst, the meta section needs a description, cape_options, strings, etc. The previous attempt was missing some parts or had incorrect syntax. I'll ensure that the meta includes all required fields and follows proper formatting.\n\nNext, for each pattern ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2), they must be 6-20 bytes long, use wildcards where necessary (like ?? for addresses or offsets), and include enough context to make them specific. I'll look at the trace data provided to find suitable sequences of instructions.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1 and #2, there are several push and pop operations around E8 and E9 patterns. Maybe these can form three different bypass paths by replacing certain bytes with wildcards. Also, ensuring each pattern is distinct from one another is crucial.\n\nI'll structure each pattern to include two or more instructions, making sure the wildcard usage covers all address or offset parts. For example, in the first pattern, I might replace E8 25 ?? ?? ?? ?? with E8 followed by four wildcards. Similarly, find other sequences in different traces to form patterns that bypass different points.\n\nI also need to include the correct description and cape_options in meta. The cape_options should reference each pattern correctly with their offsets.\n\nFinally, I'll format all this into the required Yara structure, ensuring no syntax errors like missing braces or incorrect spacing.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule using specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 ?? ???? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
