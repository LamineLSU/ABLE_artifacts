The main issues are missing basic structure and wildcard usage.\n\nFirst, looking at the original rule, it's missing some essential parts: a description and the cape_options. The meta section should include these. The condition is set to 'any of them', which seems okay, but each pattern needs to be specific with wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nThe original patterns have some issues where they don't meet the 6-20 byte requirement and might not use wildcards correctly. Also, the instruction sequences in $pattern1 are repeated from $pattern0, which is a problem because we need three distinct patterns.\n\nI'll start by creating three unique patterns based on the provided trace data. Each pattern should include relevant instructions with wildcards where applicable. For example, using E8C8FFFF as a call and including wildcards for any unknown offsets or addresses.\n\nNext, I'll ensure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long. I might combine two or three consecutive instructions to form the patterns. Also, making sure that all address/offset bytes are replaced with '??' where necessary.\n\nThen, I'll structure the meta section properly, adding a description and including the cape_options with bp0, bp1, bp2 pointing to each pattern plus zero offset since they don't have any additional steps after the call.\n\nFinally, I'll verify that all three patterns are different from each other, covering various ways the bypass could be attempted based on the trace data.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection using multiple bypass points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            8B45          # mov eax, [ebp+8h]\n            FF7508        # push dword ptr [ebp+8h] (offset 0x0)\n            E8C8FFFFFF   # call 0040E7C3h\n            ??            # Wildcard for address after call\n            ????          # Wildcard for offset after call\n            ??            # Wildcard for next instruction after call\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            FF7508        # push dword ptr [ebp+8h] (offset 0x0)\n            E8C8FFFFFF   # call 0040E7C3h\n            ??            # Wildcard for address before call\n            ????          # Wildcard for offset before call\n            ??            # Wildcard for next instruction after call\n            FF15ACB04100 # call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            8BEC          # mov ebp, esp\n            E8C8FFFFFF   # call 0040E7C3h\n            ??            # Wildcard for address before call\n            ????          # Wildcard for offset after call\n            ??            # Wildcard for next instruction\n        }\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to correct the Yara rule based on the provided information and fix the syntax errors. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: there's a syntax error in the rule file. The main issues are braces not being properly closed, hex pattern invalidation due to extra characters like 'H', and incorrect string assignment format for $name = { ... }.\n\nIn the original rule, I see that the strings section has patterns with spaces between bytes but also includes 'H' at the end of some lines. Yara doesn't accept 'H' in hex literals; each byte should be two hex digits without any trailing characters except possibly a space. Also, the braces around the hex might not be correctly placed.\n\nLooking at the original strings:\n\n$pattern0 = { 8B45  E7EE  55 8BEC FF7508FEB0ACh }\nThis has 'H' and extra spaces. It should be corrected to remove the 'H' and ensure each byte is properly spaced.\n\nSimilarly, $pattern1 and $pattern2 have similar issues with spacing and include invalid characters.\n\nThe correct format for Yara strings in hex should be without any trailing letters like 'h' or 'H', just two hex digits per byte separated by spaces. Also, each line inside the string shouldn't have extra lines unless properly enclosed.\n\nSo I'll need to rewrite each pattern, ensuring that:\n\n- Each byte is correctly represented as two hex digits.\n- Braces are placed correctly around each $pattern definition.\n- The strings section uses proper syntax with braces and no trailing letters.\n\nLooking at the example given in the validation strategy, the good examples show patterns like `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` which is correct. So I should follow that structure.\n\nNow, considering the instructions from the trace data:\n\nFor pattern0, it's looking for E8C8FFFF followed by something. But in the corrected rule, we need to extract a valid 6-20 byte pattern without 'H' and with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI'll create three distinct patterns based on the given traces. Each should be around 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nPattern0 could capture E8C8FFFF followed by some context, but I need to make sure it's correctly formed without 'H' and with appropriate wildcards.\n\nWait, in the original rule, $pattern0 was { 8B45 ... }, which is correct. But due to syntax issues, that's why validation failed. So each pattern needs to be properly enclosed within braces and have correct line breaks if necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the original rule used '??' as wildcards correctly except in some cases where it might not be applied properly across all bytes.\n\nSo I'll ensure each $pattern is a valid Yara string, with proper spacing and no trailing letters. Also, each pattern must start with $pattern0 = { ... }, etc., inside braces.\n\nPutting it all together, the corrected rule should have three patterns without 'H', correctly formatted with wildcards where necessary, and each enclosed properly in Yara syntax.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rules targeting multiple calls and conditional jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 E7EE 55 8BEC FF75 08FEB0ACh }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A8B CE83 C4FF ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B EC ??\n                      ?? ?? ?? ?? 55 8BEC FF75 08 ??\n                      }\n        $pattern2 = { ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 45 ??

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts and the given trace data. Let's start by understanding what was done before.\n\nIn Iteration 1 and 2, the same rule hit but didn't find new signatures. The current best rule has no patterns yet. Looking at the trace provided, there are two exit processes happening with similar instructions except for the call address.\n\nThe original traces show that both calls go to 0040E7C3h and then to a dword ptr [0041B0ACh]. So, perhaps the bypass should target these specific instruction sequences before the exit calls. \n\nConsidering the strategies:\n\nStrategy A: Check early in the trace for a call followed by TEST EAX or JE/JNE.\nStrategy B: Look for conditional checks before exiting via ExitProcess/TerminateProcess.\nStrategy C: Use unique techniques like timing or detection, but since there's no specific info, maybe stick to Strategy A and B.\n\nSince previous attempts didn't find new signatures, the patterns matched were either too late (at exit) or not specific enough. To avoid this, I'll make sure the patterns are earlier in the trace and more specific.\n\nLooking at the traces:\n\nIn both cases, after the call, there's a TEST EAX (0040E7F3: FF7508 is pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], which might be part of the test). Then before the exit, there are pop instructions and another push.\n\nI think targeting the TEST EAX or JE/JNE right after the call could work. Also, maybe the conditional checks like JB or JG that determine if the exit is correct.\n\nSo, creating three patterns:\n\n1. After the call to 0040E7C3h, check for a TEST EAX followed by JE/JNE.\n2. Check before the exit for a conditional jump (like JB, JG).\n3. Maybe after the push dword ptr [ebp+08h], check for specific operations like JB or JZ.\n\nThis way, I'm targeting different points where bypass could occur without causing issues and ensuring specificity to avoid matching wrong locations.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe previous attempts failed because the patterns matched at the exit calls but didn't prevent the bypass effectively. By targeting earlier in the trace, specifically right after the call and before conditional checks, we can create more specific bypass conditions that are harder for the malware to detect.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**  \n1. **CALL_TEST_JE**: Look for a call followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE.\n2. **CMP_SETZ**: Check for comparison or zero checks right before exit decision.\n3. **JE/JNE Conditional**: Target conditional jumps after specific operations to bypass the exit logic.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with multiple conditions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 FC FF75 08 ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 59 FF75 08 ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF75 08 3D ???? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
