        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to analyze this malware trace to figure out a bypass rule that an antivirus is using. The user provided two traces where the execution terminated early due to sandbox evasion. My task is to extract three different 6-20 byte patterns from these traces and create YARA rules based on them.\n\nFirst, let me look at the provided data. There are two trace entries: one exiting at 00F261E7 and another at 003361E7. Both have a similar structure but different disassembled instructions. I need to extract patterns from these traces that could represent how the bypass is being implemented.\n\nLooking at the first trace, the call sequence starts with E817D00000 which is a call instruction. Then, it does some comparisons and jumps based on the result. The key part here seems to be the conditional jump after the comparison. There's an E84F000000 call as well.\n\nIn the second trace, again there are similar steps: E817D00000 is called, followed by some manipulation of registers and memory. It also has a later E84F000000 call but in a different context.\n\nI need to create patterns that capture these specific evasive behaviors. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions with wildcards where necessary.\n\nFor the first pattern, let's focus on the initial conditional jump. Maybe something around the E817D00000 call and surrounding instructions. It could involve a comparison (test al, 01h) followed by a jump if not equal (jne). So combining these operations might give a specific enough pattern.\n\nThe second pattern might be from the later E84F000000 call in the first trace. This is an interrupt or function call instruction with an offset. I should include this and maybe some context before it, like moving eax into a memory address.\n\nFor the third pattern, looking at the second trace's later calls, perhaps another instance of E84F000000 but in a different location. Maybe after pushing some registers or modifying ebp.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and doesn't overlap too much with others. Also, applying wildcards correctly for address/offset bytes while keeping opcodes and register moves concrete.\n\nLet me draft the first pattern: maybe starting from E817D00000 (call) up to after the test al instruction. That might be around 12 bytes long. Including the je instruction as well, since it's part of the control flow.\n\nSecond pattern could start with pushing eax in the second trace and then the call instruction. Maybe from 50 (push) up to E84F000000, which is 6 instructions or so, giving a 12-byte pattern.\n\nThird pattern might be similar but slightly different, perhaps after another push or a different jump.\n\nWait, I should check each trace's instruction count. Let me recount:\n\nFirst trace:\n- Line starts at 00F261AC (8BFF) and ends at 00F261E7 (call dword ptr). Counting the number of instructions from E817D00000 to E84F000000 would give a specific pattern.\n\nSecond trace:\n- The second call is at 003361DB, so maybe starting from 50 (push) up to that point. Maybe around the same length as the first pattern.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern has enough context without being too long. Let me try constructing them:\n\nPattern 0: E817D00000 (call), then some instructions, including test al, jne, etc. So maybe from E817D00000 up to after the je instruction.\n\nPattern 1: The push eax and the call dword ptr in the second trace.\n\nPattern 2: Maybe another instance of pushing and a different jump elsewhere.\n\nWait, but I need each pattern to be specific enough. Let me try to capture these steps more concretely.\n\nFor Pattern 0:\n- Start with E817D00000 (call), then 55 (push ebp), 8BEC (mov ebp, esp), then the call at 00F331CDh. Then some comparisons and jumps.\n\nWait, but I need to capture a sequence that includes these steps with wildcards for addresses or offsets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe focusing on the E84F000000 instruction in both traces as it's a common point of evasion.\n\nPattern 0: E817D00000 (call), followed by some operations and then E84F000000 with an offset. Maybe including the je instruction after.\n\nPattern 1: The call at 0035508Ch in the first trace, which is a different offset but similar structure.\n\nPattern 2: Another instance of the same call but perhaps with a different context, like pushing before or after.\n\nI think I need to create three distinct patterns that each capture specific behavior from these traces. Each should be around 12 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary and keeping opcodes concrete.\n\nLet me try writing them:\n\nPattern0: E817D00000 (call), then moving eax into a memory address (C1E8 shr, test al, jne jump). So maybe from E817D up to the je instruction. That could be around 12 bytes.\n\nPattern1: The push of eax and the call dword ptr in the second trace. So starting at 50 (push) up to E84F000000, which is about 6 instructions, so maybe 12 bytes including the offset.\n\nPattern2: Another instance where after pushing, a different jump instruction is used with an offset elsewhere in the code.\n\nWait, but I have to ensure that each pattern captures the specific evasive behavior without overlapping too much. Maybe Pattern0 is from the first trace's early call, Pattern1 is the same call but in the second trace, and Pattern2 is another instance of a similar structure elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe capturing different parts like after the push and before the call, or including more context.\n\nI think I need to be careful with how many instructions each pattern includes. Let me try structuring them:\n\nPattern0: E817D00000 (call), 55 (push ebp), 8BEC (mov ebp, esp), C1E8 (shr eax, 08h), A801 (test al, 01h), 7510 (jne ...). So this is from E817D up to the jne. That's about 6 instructions plus some, maybe 12 bytes.\n\nPattern1: In the second trace, after pushing ebp and moving, there's a call with an offset in 003550A0h. Maybe capturing that part as well.\n\nPattern2: Another instance where after push, a different jump or instruction follows.\n\nI think I can draft these patterns now, making sure to include wildcards for any address or offset and keep the opcodes concrete.\n</think>\n\nHere is the YARA rule based on the identified patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass through conditional jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B458C50F400 }  # Represents a specific memory address\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508C65000 }   # Represents an offset in the first trace\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508A35000 }   # Represents another offset in the second trace\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

        "prompt_tokens": 2045,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help fix the Yara rule based on the given trace data and correct the previous mistakes. Let's start by understanding what was wrong in the initial attempt.\n\nFirst, the error analysis mentioned that each pattern must be between 6-20 bytes long. The original patterns were too short\u20143 and 5 bytes respectively\u2014and needed to be expanded to at least 6 bytes. Also, all address/offset bytes should be replaced with `??` as wildcards. \n\nLooking at the trace data for both TRACe #1 and #2, I can see several instructions that include calls and conditional jumps. My goal is to extract exactly three different patterns from these traces, each meeting the length requirement.\n\nFor the first pattern, let's look at the call instruction E8 in TRACE #1. The instruction before it is 00F261AC: mov edi, edi; then 00F261AE: push ebp; next 00F261AF: mov ebp, esp; followed by E817D00000 as the call instruction.\n\nI'll combine these four instructions into a pattern. Since the offset is fixed (D0000), I can replace it with `??`. So the pattern would be 8B45FC (mov edi, edi) plus the next two push and mov, but wait\u2014E817D00000 is at offset D0000. Maybe a better approach is to take E8 followed by the four bytes of the call.\n\nSo, the pattern would be: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (since 4 bytes after E8). But I need more context to make it specific. Let's include the previous instructions: from the instruction before the call, maybe the mov ebp, esp and push ebp? Or perhaps take a few more instructions around.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the conditional jump in the trace\u2014looking at TRACE #1, there's 7420 je 00F261DBh. This could be part of another pattern.\n\nWait, I think it's better to extract patterns that include the target instruction and some surrounding context to ensure specificity. Let me plan each pattern:\n\nPattern 1: Around E817D00000 call in TRACE #1. Maybe take the E8 (call) plus the next four bytes as wildcards, but I need more context.\n\nWait, maybe better to capture a sequence that includes the call and surrounding movs.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n00F261AC: 8B45FC\n00F261AE: 55\n00F261AF: 8BEC\n00F261B1: E817D00000 (call)\nSo the pattern could be starting from E8 to D0000, but since D is a wildcard, it's better to represent as ??.\n\nBut to make it specific, maybe include the previous mov ebp, esp and push ebp. So:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nBut that might not be enough; perhaps I need more bytes around.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe take from 00F261AC (mov edi, edi) up to E8 instruction plus some context after the call.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on a specific sequence like the conditional jump:\n\nIn TRACE #1, there's 7420 je 00F261DBh. So maybe create a pattern around that: 74 ?? ??. But again, need at least 6 bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to capture each instruction and surrounding context for each pattern. Let me try:\n\nPattern 1: The call E8 with offset D0000 (but make it wildcard). So the pattern is E8 followed by four wildcards.\n\nBut that would be only 5 bytes\u2014E8 plus four ??, which is too short. I need at least 6 bytes. Therefore, maybe include a few more instructions before or after.\n\nLooking again: Before E817D00000 call, there's 00F261AF (mov ebp, esp) and then push ebp on 00F261AE. Maybe I can take from mov ebp, esp up to the call.\n\nSo the instructions would be:\n\n8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n55\nE817D00000\n\nWait, but E8 is a single byte for call, followed by four bytes as offset. So maybe taking 8BEC (3 bytes) + 55 (1) + E8? Or perhaps it's better to include the entire context leading up to the call.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the conditional jump: 7420 je 00F261DBh. Let's extract a pattern from that.\n\nPattern 2 could be around the je instruction with some surrounding bytes. Maybe including the 74 and next few instructions as wildcards.\n\nWait, another approach is to look for similar structures in the trace. For example, there are multiple calls:\n\nIn TRACE #1: E817D00000 at line 5\nIn TRACE #2: FF158C503500 and FF15A0503500 as call instructions.\n\nSo perhaps creating patterns based on these call sequences, ensuring that offset bytes are wildcards.\n\nLet me outline the plan:\n\n- **Pattern 0**: Around E8 in TRACE #1: include mov ebp, esp; push ebp; mov edi, edi; call ... (wildcard)\n- **Pattern 1**: Conditional jump je followed by some instructions\n- **Pattern 2**: Another specific sequence from the trace\n\nAlternatively, since each pattern must be unique and specific, I'll extract three different instruction sequences.\n\nFor Pattern 0: Let's take the mov ebp, esp (8BEC), then push ebp (55), then E817D00000. So:\n\n8BEC is a byte; 55 is another; E8 plus four wildcards. But that would be too short. Maybe include more bytes: perhaps from the mov before E8.\n\nWait, let's see: The sequence leading to the call is:\n\n00F261AC: 8B45FC\n00F261AE: 55\n00F261AF: 8BEC\n00F261B1: E817D00000\n\nSo the pattern could be from 8BEC (mov ebp, esp) up to E8. So that's four bytes: 8B EC 55 E8? Or maybe include more.\n\nAlternatively, take 8BEC as part of the pattern:\n\n$pattern0 = { 8B EC ?? ?? ?? }\n\nWait, but this might not be enough; need at least six bytes. Maybe better to capture a longer sequence.\n\nAnother idea: The call instruction is preceded by push ebp and mov ebp, esp. So maybe include those instructions plus the call as part of pattern 0.\n\nSo:\n\n55 (push ebp)\n8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\nE817D00000\n\nThat's three bytes; not enough. Maybe add more context: like before push ebp.\n\nLooking further back: 00F261AE is 55 (push ebp). Before that, maybe the previous instruction? Wait, the trace starts at F261AC, so perhaps no prior instructions except maybe some initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, since there's no instruction before 55 in this trace snippet, I'll have to work with what's available. So pattern0 could be:\n\n8B45FC (mov edi, edi)\n55\n8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\nE817D00000\n\nSo that's four bytes: FC EC 55 E8. Not enough; need at least six.\n\nWait, but each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long. So perhaps include more of the surrounding instructions or combine multiple instructions into one pattern.\n\nLet me try combining from instruction to instruction:\n\nFrom 8B45FC (mov edi, edi) up to E817D00000: that's five bytes. Still short.\n\nIncluding another instruction after E8 would make it six bytes: E8 plus four wildcards and one more instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps better to take the call instruction and include some surrounding context for specificity.\n\nAlternatively, focus on other parts of the trace where there are unique sequences.\n\nLooking at TRACE #2:\n\n003361CE: FF158C503500\n003361DB: FF7508 (call)\nSo this is a call instruction with offset 3500. So maybe pattern1 can be the call to FF158C503500, but that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, using the conditional jumps in both traces:\n\nIn TRACE #1: 7420 je ...\nIn TRACE #2: 741A je ...\n\nSo perhaps capture a sequence around these je instructions with wildcards.\n\nSimilarly, for Pattern 2, maybe take another call instruction from the trace.\n\nLet me draft three patterns now:\n\nPattern 0:\nFrom mov ebp, esp (8BEC) to E8 plus some context. Let's include push ebp and mov ebp, esp as part of the pattern.\n\nBut need at least six bytes. Maybe 8BEC is one byte; then add E8 plus four wildcards: that would be five bytes total\u2014still too short. So perhaps take more instructions:\n\n00F261AC: 8B45FC\n00F261AE: 55 (push ebp)\n00F261AF: 8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n00F261B1: E817D00000\n\nSo combining these four bytes as a pattern would be too short. Alternatively, maybe take the 55 (push), 8BEC (mov), and E8 plus three wildcards.\n\nBut that's still five bytes. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focus on the je instruction in both traces:\n\nIn TRACE #1: 7420 je ...\nIn TRACE #2: 741A je ...\n\nSo for Pattern 1, create a sequence around these je instructions with some context.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nFor TRACE #1:\n7420 je 00F261DBh\nThen E8 instruction follows after.\n\nWait, perhaps take from 74 to E8 plus offset as wildcards.\n\nSimilarly for TRACE #2: 741A je ... followed by some instructions.\n\nAlternatively, create a pattern that includes the conditional jump and surrounding context:\n\nIn both traces, there's a je followed by a displacement. So let me capture this sequence with wildcards.\n\nFor Pattern 1:\n74 (je) plus next four bytes as wildcards: 74 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut need more context to make it specific\u2014maybe include some preceding instructions or the target instruction.\n\nAnother idea is to combine the je, the displacement, and a few following instructions.\n\nIn TRACE #2:\n\n003361CE: FF158C503500 (call)\n003361DB: FF7508 (je ...)\nThen 003361DE: E84F000000\n\nSo the je instruction is at 003361DB, followed by call. So perhaps create a pattern from je to the next few instructions.\n\nBut since I can't reference specific offsets easily in Yara, it's better to use wildcards for addresses and concrete opcode bytes.\n\nPutting this together, Pattern 1 could be:\n\n74 ?? ??.??.??. (je followed by four wildcards)\n\nBut again, need at least six bytes. So including more instructions before je or after might help.\n\nAlternatively, include the target instruction's address as a wildcard.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to take a few bytes from each trace that form unique sequences and combine them into patterns with wildcards where necessary.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 0: The call E8 plus four wildcards (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??)\nBut need more context; include the previous mov ebp, esp before E8.\n\nSo Pattern 0 would be 55 (push) + 8BEC (mov) + E817D00000. But that's only five bytes\u2014again too short.\n\nWait, perhaps combine push ebp and mov ebp, esp with the call:\n\nPattern 0: 55 8BEC E8 ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's seven bytes? Wait, no\u2014each instruction is one byte. So 55 (1), 8BEC (2), E8 (3). That's three bytes; too short.\n\nHmm, maybe combine more instructions to reach six bytes.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n00F261AC: 8B45FC\n00F261AE: 55\n00F261AF: 8BEC\n00F261B1: E817D00000\n\nIf I take from 8B45FC to E8, that's five bytes. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, include the next instruction after E8: 83C4 (jne). So Pattern 0 could be:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ??.83 C4 ...\n\nBut need at least six bytes.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to take a different approach by looking for other unique sequences in the trace that are longer and can form valid patterns.\n\nLooking at the trace, another possible sequence is around the call FF15A0503500:\n\nIn TRACE #2: 003361CE: FF158C503500 (call)\nThen next instruction is E84F000000.\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 2 can be FF158C followed by some wildcards and the E8 instruction.\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to create three separate patterns. Maybe each pattern can capture a unique call instruction from the traces.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 0: The first call in TRACE #1 (E8) with offset D.\n- So E8 ?? ?? ?? ??. But need six bytes; perhaps include the previous mov and push.\n\nBut again, that's not enough. Maybe take more instructions before or after.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each pattern as a sequence of three to four consecutive instructions, including the target call and surrounding context.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 0: From E817D00000 (call) plus next few bytes:\nE8 ?? ?? ??.??. \n\nBut again, not enough. Maybe combine with the previous instruction: 55 (push ebp). So Pattern 0 could be 55 followed by E8 and four wildcards.\n\nWait, that's five bytes\u2014too short. Alternatively, include more instructions:\n\nPattern 0: 55 (push) + 8BEC (mov) + E817D00000\n\nThat's three bytes; still too short. Maybe add the next instruction after E8: 83C4 jne.\n\nSo Pattern 0 becomes: 55 8BEC E8 83 C4 ?? \n\nNow that's six bytes! So $pattern0 = {55 8BEC E8 83 C4 ??}\n\nWait, but the E8 instruction is followed by a jne, which would be 83C4. So combining these:\n\nPattern 0: push ebp (55) + mov ebp, esp (8BEC) + call ... (E817D00000) + jne ...\n\nSo as bytes:\n\n55 8BEC E8 83 C4 ?? \n\nThat's six bytes. Perfect.\n\nPattern 1: Another unique sequence from the trace.\n\nLooking at TRACE #2, there are two calls: FF158C503500 and FF15A0503500. Let me see their surrounding instructions.\n\nIn TRACE #2:\n\nAt 003361CE: FF158C503500 (call)\nNext instruction is E84F000000\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 1 can be the call FF158C503500 plus some wildcards.\n\nBut to make it unique and specific, maybe include surrounding context. So:\n\nFrom 74 ?? ??.??.?? ?\n\nWait, another idea: Look for conditional jumps (je/jmp) in the trace. For example, in both traces there are je instructions with offsets.\n\nIn TRACE #1: 7420 je 00F261DBh\nIn TRACE #2: 741A je 003361DEb\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 1 can be the je instruction plus surrounding context, using wildcards for address bytes.\n\nPattern 1 could be:\n\n74 ?? ??.??.??. \n\nIncluding some preceding instructions to make it specific. Maybe include the target instruction's displacement as a wildcard.\n\nBut let's structure it properly with six bytes.\n\nPerhaps: 74 (je) + next three instructions plus two wildcards.\n\nWait, perhaps take from 74 up to E8 in both traces and create a pattern that includes je followed by some context.\n\nAlternatively, capture the je instruction and its target displacement:\n\nPattern 1: 74 ?? ??.??.?? \n\nBut need six bytes. Let me see the exact addresses:\n\nIn TRACE #1:\nje is at 00F261DBh (hex). The next instruction after je is E8.\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 1 could be from je to E8 plus some context.\n\nWait, another approach: Take the je instruction and its displacement as wildcards. So:\n\n74 ?? ??.??.?? \n\nThat's five bytes\u2014too short. Maybe add more instructions before or after je.\n\nAlternatively, include the target instruction in the pattern. For example, je followed by a displacement of 00F261DBh (hex). But that's too specific unless we replace it with wildcards.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 1: 74 ?? ??.??.??. \n\nBut again, only five bytes. Maybe add another instruction after E8 to make six bytes.\n\nWait, in TRACE #1:\n\nAfter the call at E8 (00F261B1), next is 83C4 jne.\n\nSo Pattern 1 could be: je ?? ??.??.?? \n\nBut combining with some context before je might help. Alternatively, take from the instruction before je to include more bytes.\n\nLooking back:\n\nBefore je in TRACE #1: 00F261AE is 55 (push ebp). So maybe Pattern 1 includes push ebp, je, and some instructions after.\n\nSo: 55 74 ?? ??.??.?? \n\nThat's six bytes. But wait, does that make sense?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to create a pattern around the je instruction with surrounding context:\n\nPattern 1 could be from 74 to E8 plus four wildcards and one more instruction.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on to Pattern 2 and come back if time permits.\n\nFor now, let me try to outline three patterns based on the traces:\n\n**Pattern 0**: Includes push ebp (55) followed by mov ebp, esp (8BEC), then E8 call with offset wildcard, plus jne (83C4). So six bytes: 55 8BEC E8 83 C4 ??\n\n**Pattern 1**: je ?? ??.??.?? ?\n\nBut this is only five bytes. To make it six, maybe include the target instruction's address as a wildcard.\n\nAlternatively, take from the je to the next instruction after call: 74 followed by some instructions plus wildcards.\n\nWait, perhaps Pattern 1 can be:\n\n74 ?? ??.??.??. \n\nBut that's only five bytes. Maybe add another instruction after E8 but before jne in TRACE #1.\n\nAlternatively, take from je to the next few instructions as wildcards.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. I think it's better to accept that each pattern needs to be at least six bytes and use wildcards where necessary without overlapping or being too specific.\n\nGiven that, here are three patterns based on the traces:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Includes push ebp (55), mov ebp, esp (8BEC), E8 call with offset wildcard, jne (83C4). So six bytes.\n2. Pattern 1: je ?? followed by some instructions to make it specific and meet length.\n3. Pattern 2: Another unique sequence from the trace.\n\nAfter considering all these factors, I'll draft three patterns that are each at least six bytes long, use wildcards where address/offsets are present, and ensure they're specific enough based on the trace data.\n</think>\n\nTo address the problem of generating a Yara rule with exactly three patterns targeting suspicious evasion points while ensuring each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and includes appropriate wildcards for addresses:\n\n### Solution Code\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 8BEC E8 83 C4 ?? }  \n        $pattern1 = { FF158C50 ?? ??.??.?? }    \n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A ?? ?? ?? ?? }    \n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Pattern 0**: Combines push ebp (55), mov ebp, esp (8BEC), E8 call with a wildcard for the displacement (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??), and jne instruction (83C4) to form a six-byte pattern.\n  \n- **Pattern 1**: Captures a unique sequence starting from FF158C50 (call) followed by wildcards for any offset, ensuring specificity.\n\n- **Pattern 2**: Includes mov eax, edx (6A ??), and wildcarded displacements for subsequent instructions to maintain uniqueness while meeting the length requirement.",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the user has two traces where the malware is attempting an ExitProcess call at specific addresses: 00F261E7 and 003361E7. Each trace has multiple instructions leading up to the call. The goal is to create a YARA rule that detects these evasion attempts by matching the patterns of these calls.\n\nThe task requires exactly three different patterns, each 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offset bytes and keeping opcode and register bytes concrete. Also, the rule must include a wildcard in the meta section for CAPE options.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I can see that each pattern is constructed by combining consecutive instructions. For instance, one example combines an instruction with its surrounding context to form a 11-byte pattern. \n\nI'll need to extract three distinct sequences from both traces. Each sequence should be 6-20 bytes and include enough context to ensure specificity.\n\nFrom the first trace, at address 00F261E7:\nThe relevant part starts with 8B FF (mov edi, edi), then E8 (call), followed by some operations leading up to the call. I can take a sequence that includes the call instruction and surrounding context.\n\nFrom the second trace at 003361E7:\nSimilar approach\u2014look for a sequence of instructions around the call point.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique, so I'll pick different parts from each trace or varying sequences within them. Also, every address or offset byte should be replaced with ?? as per wildcard rules.\n\nNow, constructing each $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2:\n\n$pattern0 could include the call instruction and surrounding operands.\n$pattern1 might start earlier in the trace with different instructions but leading to a similar call.\n$pattern2 can cover another part of the second trace, ensuring it's distinct from the others.\n\nI'll also need to ensure each pattern is wrapped correctly in braces and has spaces between hex bytes. The meta section must include the correct cape_options string referencing each pattern.\n\nFinally, I'll compile all this into the YARA rule format provided, making sure there are exactly three patterns with the correct structure.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection targeting specific call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            74 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            0F 85 8C ?? ?? ?? ?? \n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of the patterns match specific call sequences aimed at bypassing security\n}\n```",
