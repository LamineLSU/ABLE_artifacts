        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to correct this Yara rule because it failed validation. The main issue is that the patterns are too short\u2014each needs to be at least 6 bytes but only 5 were given. Also, each pattern must include context instructions around the target to avoid triggering other signatures.\n\nLooking at the original patterns:\n\n- $pattern0 is { E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nWait, that actually looks like it's longer than 6 bytes. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the length.\n\nEach pattern is a sequence of hex bytes separated by spaces. So, for example:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nBreaking it down: Starting from E8, that's one byte, then each ?? is a byte, and so on. Counting them:\n\nE8, ?, 5A, 8B, CE, E8, ?, ?, ?, ?, 85, C0, 0F, 84, ?, ?, ?, ? \n\nThat's more than 6 bytes. So maybe it was okay in length but had the wrong number of patterns or other issues.\n\nWait, looking back at the user's message, they provided three patterns:\n\n- $pattern0: E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??\n  \nThat seems like it could be around 16 bytes.\n\nBut according to the error analysis, each pattern must be at least 6 bytes. So maybe they were too long but still incorrect because of address/offsets not being replaced with ??? Also, some patterns might have duplicates or didn't include enough context.\n\nThe user's previous rule had three patterns:\n\n- $pattern0: E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??\n  \nWait, actually, each pattern in the strings section needs to be properly formatted with wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nSo perhaps I need to adjust each pattern to include surrounding instructions and ensure that all address bytes are replaced with ??.\n\nAlso, the cape_options must reference these patterns correctly. The previous rule had \"count=0\", which is probably wrong because Yara rules typically use a count parameter for how many bypass attempts to try before giving up. So I should replace \"count=0\" with something like \"count=2\".\n\nAdditionally, in the strings section, each pattern must be exactly 6-20 bytes long and consist of hex values with wildcards where necessary.\n\nSo, let me think about creating three distinct patterns:\n\n1. One that includes a TEST instruction followed by JZ or similar.\n2. Another that involves a conditional jump (like 74/75) plus an offset.\n3. A third pattern involving a call and some stack manipulation.\n\nEach should be around 8-10 bytes, with wildcards for any address/offsets.\n\nLet me draft each:\n\nPattern 1: TEST EAX + JZ (jump on zero)\nSomething like 89 EAX ?? 74 ?A\n\nWait, maybe more context. Let's think of an instruction sequence that includes the target plus surrounding instructions with wildcards where needed.\n\nAlternatively, considering the trace data provided by the user:\n\nLooking at the trace, we can extract sequences from the call and jump instructions to create patterns.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. The first pattern could be around the TEST EAX + JZ (jump on zero) instruction.\nSomething like 89 EAX ?? 74 ?A \n\nBut need to make it longer. Let's see: 89, EAX, ??, 74, ?, ?\n\nSo maybe:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nWait, that seems similar to the previous one but with placeholders.\n\nBut perhaps I need to ensure each pattern has at least 6 bytes and includes the target instruction plus surrounding context.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern 1: TEST EAX + JZ\nBytes: 89 (TEST), EAX, ??, 74 (JZ), ??\n\nSo that would be 5 bytes. Need one more, maybe include a nearby instruction like 0F or something else.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to take an instruction from the trace and build around it.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nLine: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nHmm, that looks like part of a pattern. So maybe $pattern1 can be this sequence with some adjustments.\n\nWait, but each pattern must be exactly 6-20 bytes and include wildcards for address/offsets.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nBut wait, that's too long. Maybe I need to adjust it to be exactly around 10 bytes.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to take three distinct instruction sequences from the trace, each including the target instruction and surrounding context, apply wildcards to any address/offsets, and ensure they are unique.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 0: TEST EAX + JZ (jump on zero)\nBytes: 89 EAX ?? 74 ??\n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. To make it 6-20 bytes, maybe add a nearby instruction or two.\n\nAlternatively, include more context around the target instruction to reach 6 bytes.\n\nSimilarly for other patterns.\n\nI think I need to create three unique hex sequences, each between 6 and 20 bytes, with wildcards where applicable.\n\nSo here's an attempt:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nWait, but that's still more than 10 bytes. Maybe I need to adjust the number of bytes by including only necessary context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use the existing example from the user and modify them:\n\nThe good example given was: `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` which is 11 bytes. So maybe I can create similar patterns with around 10-12 bytes.\n\nSo, let me draft three patterns accordingly.\n\nFirst pattern: TEST EAX + JZ\nBytes: 89 EAX ?? 74 ??\n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. Maybe add another instruction before or after to make it 6 bytes.\n\nAlternatively, use the example given and adjust:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nThat's 12 bytes, which is acceptable.\n\nSecond pattern: Conditional Jump (JMP near)\nBytes: 74 ?? ??\n\nBut that's only 3 bytes. Maybe include more context:\n\n$pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? 74 ?? ???? }\n\nWait, but the user had an example with 6A and others.\n\nAlternatively, using a call instruction as in the trace:\n\nFrom the trace: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nSo maybe create $pattern1 from that sequence:\n\n$pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nBut wait, the user had this as a string for $pattern2. So perhaps I can adjust it to be shorter.\n\nAlternatively, take part of it and include wildcards:\n\n$pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 }\n\nBut that's still too long.\n\nWait, maybe each pattern should be around 8-12 bytes. So perhaps:\n\n$pattern0: TEST JZ with some context\n$pattern1: Conditional jump (JMP near) with offset\n$pattern2: Call instruction with stack displacement\n\nSo:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?A }\n\nThat's 9 bytes.\n\nWait, but I need to include the target instruction and surrounding context. Maybe better to structure each pattern as follows:\n\n- Include the target instruction at position +0.\n- Add 2 or more instructions before and after it with wildcards where necessary.\n\nSo for example, TEST EAX + JZ (74):\nBytes: 89 EAX ?? 74 ??\n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. To make it 6 bytes, maybe add a nearby instruction:\n\n$pattern0 = { 89 EAX ?? 74 ?? }\n\nThat's 6 bytes.\n\nSimilarly for the next pattern:\n\nConditional jump near (JMP):\nBytes: 0F 84 ??\n\nBut that's only 3. Maybe include more context:\n\n$pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? 74 ?A }\n\nWait, but I need to make sure to replace any address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nAlternatively, using the call instruction from the trace: E8 and others.\n\nMaybe $pattern2 can be a call plus some stack operations.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to refer back to the user's example where they had:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nWhich is similar to TEST EAX + JZ, so perhaps I can create another pattern around that.\n\nAlternatively, using the trace data line: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nSo maybe $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nBut that's too long, so perhaps take a substring.\n\nWait, the user had three patterns:\n\n$pattern0: TEST EAX + JZ\n$pattern1: Conditional jump near (JMP)\n$pattern2: Call instruction\n\nSo I can create similar ones from the trace data.\n\nLet me attempt to draft three distinct patterns with 6-20 bytes each, including surrounding context and wildcards.\n</think>\n\nTo correct the Yara rule, ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes, uses wildcards for address/offsets, and includes unique instruction sequences.
