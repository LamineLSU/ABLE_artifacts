        "prompt_tokens": 2258,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create YARA bypass rules based on the given trace data. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nLooking at the traces, it seems like there are three different evasion points where the code is trying to bypass some checks. Each trace has a series of instructions that probably represent attempts to trick the security mechanism into allowing execution beyond certain points.\n\nThe task is to generate YARA rules with exactly three different patterns targeting these suspicious points. Each pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long, combining consecutive instructions from the traces. Also, I need to apply wildcards (??) where there are address or offset bytes and keep opcode and register encodings concrete.\n\nFirst, let's look at each trace one by one to identify potential patterns.\n\nStarting with TRACE #1: It ends with a call to [0045642Ch], so that might be the target. Looking through the instructions before this call, I see an OR operation (8B 45 EC) followed by some movs and jumps. Maybe combining these around the OR and the subsequent calls would form a pattern.\n\nNext, TRACE #2: Ends with a call to [0045642Ch] as well. This trace has more instructions before the call. Perhaps the OR instruction is further back here? Wait, no, in this trace, it's also ending at 0045642Ch but maybe from a different path.\n\nTRACE #3: Ends with a call to [0045642Ch] too. This one has some specific instructions involving EC and EDh addresses. Maybe combining the OR instruction here with surrounding context would form another pattern.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that all three traces end at the same dword ptr [0045642Ch]. So perhaps this is a common target point, like an API call or something similar. The differences in the trace steps might be due to different execution paths but trying to reach the same point.\n\nSo, for each trace, I can extract a sequence of instructions that leads up to the OR and then the call, applying wildcards where needed.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1:\nThe relevant part is near line 00411B46. Before the final call, there's an OR instruction (8B 45 EC) followed by some movs and jumps. So maybe combining these around the OR would form a pattern.\n\nIn TRACE #2:\nLooking at the end, it also has FF152C644500 as the call. Before that, perhaps there's an OR instruction somewhere else? Wait, no, in this trace, it ends directly after some push and pop operations leading to the call.\n\nTRACE #3 is similar but with different steps before the final call. It has more instructions involving EC and EDh addresses.\n\nI need to combine these into patterns that capture the context around the OR instruction and the call.\n\nFor pattern0, maybe combining the OR (8B 45 EC) with some surrounding jumps or movs. But since each trace is different, I might have overlapping ORs but in different contexts.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for a common point where all three traces are trying to reach, which is the dword ptr [0045642Ch]. So maybe focusing on that area and extracting similar instruction sequences from each trace would help create unique patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I can take specific instructions known to be part of bypassing. For example, in each trace, after the OR operation, there's a call or some mov operations before reaching the target. Maybe capturing those sequences with wildcards for any addresses or offsets.\n\nBut since each pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes and distinct, I should extract different instruction sequences from each trace leading up to the same target point.\n\nLet me try outlining possible patterns:\n\n1. From TRACE #1: The OR (8B 45 EC) followed by some movs and jumps before the call.\n   Maybe combining these into a pattern where OR is preceded by certain instructions.\n\n2. From TRACE #2: Perhaps an earlier OR or a different sequence leading to the same target, maybe involving different stack pushes or pops.\n\n3. From TRACE #3: Another variation of the same steps but with different surrounding instructions that also lead to the target.\n\nEach of these would form distinct 6-20 byte patterns with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and captures enough context to match only the evasion points, using ?? for any address or offset bytes, keeping opcodes concrete.\n\nSo after considering all this, I can draft three different YARA rules targeting these specific addresses.\n</think>\n\nTo create YARA bypass rules based on the provided traces, we analyze the instruction sequences leading up to the target dword ptr [0045642Ch]. Each trace represents a different execution path but attempts to reach the same point. We extract unique instruction patterns from each trace and apply wildcards where address/offset bytes are involved.\n\n### YARA Bypass Rules\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionBypass {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rules targeting dword ptr [0045642Ch]\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 45 EC ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 EC ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { EB 45 D8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 7D F8 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Pattern0**: Combines the OR instruction (8B 45 EC) with surrounding context from TRACE #1, capturing a specific sequence that could bypass security checks.\n   \n2. **Pattern1**: Includes instructions from TRACE #2, featuring a different sequence involving PUSH and POP operations before reaching the target.\n\n3. **Pattern2**: Extracts another unique sequence from TRACE #3, incorporating EC and EDh addresses to form a distinct bypass pattern.\n\nEach pattern uses wildcards (??) for address/offset bytes and keeps opcode and register encodings concrete, ensuring specificity and effectiveness in bypassing security mechanisms.",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to analyze the given trace data and generate a YARA bypass rule with three different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the trace provided. It seems to involve multiple calls and memory accesses. From what I can see, there are several call instructions like FF 15 2C 64 45 00, which is a call with an offset of 0x00. There's also some manipulation of registers and memory locations.\n\nI notice that in the trace, there are multiple points where the code calls dword ptr [0045642Ch]. This seems like a potential target for bypassing because it's being called from different addresses (like B4B C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? and another similar pattern). So, these might be good points to focus on.\n\nNext, I need to extract three distinct patterns. Each pattern should include the target instruction plus surrounding context. Since the offset is usually zero in some cases, maybe that's part of the pattern.\n\nFor the first pattern, looking at B4B C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??, I can see that it includes an ORR (or immediate) and a mov. This seems like a common way to bypass such calls by testing conditions or manipulating registers.\n\nThe second pattern might involve more complex instructions, perhaps combining E8 with other jumps. Maybe something like E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? would work. This could be a conditional jump that's being bypassed by manipulating the stack.\n\nThe third pattern might involve pushing and popping values to create context for the bypass, such as 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0. This combines push, pop, move, call, test, ORR, mov, etc., making it a more complex bypass.\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern uses wildcards for address/offset bytes and keeps opcode and register-encoding concrete. Also, each pattern must be between 6-20 bytes long, so I'll make sure they're all within that range.\n\nFinally, I'll format the YARA rule with three patterns, making sure each is wrapped in curly braces and includes the necessary wildcards and concrete instructions.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific call points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { B4 B C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to create a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace. The task is to extract three different patterns that target suspicious evasion points. Each pattern should be between 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards where applicable.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the traces provided for the task. There are multiple calls with similar structures, especially around the `FF152C` instructions which call dword ptr [0045642Ch]. This suggests that the target is at 0045642Ch plus some displacement.\n\nLooking at the first trace (TRACE E1), there's a call at line 80: `FF 15 2C 64 45 03`. So, this is likely a call to an address. The pattern around this would involve the instruction before and after. But since I can't use absolute addresses without context, maybe focusing on relative jumps or nearby instructions might help.\n\nIn the second trace (TRACE E2), there are multiple calls at different points like 0041B8E0, 0041C9CC, etc., each with `FF 15 2C 64 45 03` and similar surrounding instructions. These could be potential targets if the code is being bypassed by moving to these addresses.\n\nLooking at the third trace (TRACE E3), there are calls again but at different offsets: 0041B9A8, 0041C9D8, etc., with the same call instruction. These could be used as targets for the bypass rule.\n\nNow, I need to create three patterns targeting these addresses. Each pattern should include the target instruction and surrounding context instructions, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nFor the first pattern, maybe focus on a near jump or a short jump leading up to the target address. In the trace E2, there's an `E8 01 F9` at line 76, which is followed by a call instruction. So combining these could form a pattern: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nFor the second pattern, perhaps use a conditional jump near (`74 1A`) with surrounding context. For example, in trace E2, there's `74 1A` at line 69. So including that and some surrounding instructions: 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nThe third pattern could target the initial call instruction from trace E1. The call is followed by moving into a register (like `8B 45 ??`). So combining these would form another pattern: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0.\n\nI also need to make sure that each pattern has at least six bytes and uses wildcards for any address or offset bytes. Additionally, ensure that all opcode and register-encoding bytes are kept concrete without wildcards.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the YARA rule with three patterns, each in the correct format, and include the necessary `cape_options` to prevent unwanted matches.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionBypassSample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting specific address calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
