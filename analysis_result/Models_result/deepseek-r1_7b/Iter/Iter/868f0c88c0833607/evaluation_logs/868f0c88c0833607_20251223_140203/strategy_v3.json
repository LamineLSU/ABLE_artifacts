(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a bypass rule for this malware based on the given traces. Let me start by looking at the traces and seeing where the attacker might have implemented checks.\n\nLooking at TRACE #3 and #4, both call 0040E7C3h and 0040E7FF. Hmm, I notice that in the first trace (TRACE #1), there's a call to E8C8FFFFFF at 0040E7F6 which then calls 0040E7C3h. Similarly, in TRACE #2, it does something similar but ends up calling 0040E7FF.\n\nWait, maybe the attacker is using some kind of conditional jump after a call to bypass certain checks. Let me see if there's an instruction that changes based on conditions.\n\nLooking at the first few traces, I notice instructions like E8C8FFFFFF being used in calls. That might be a conditional jump or part of a check. For example, 0040E7F6 has a call to FF15ACB04100 which is a dword ptr [0041B0ACh]. Maybe that's the target address.\n\nIn another trace like TRACE #3 and #5, there are calls like E8C8FFFFFF leading into 0040E7C3h. So perhaps after calling this function, it does something else to bypass detection.\n\nWait, in TRACE #1 and #2, they call 0040E7F6 which is FF15ACB04100. Then there's another call at 0040E7FF (which is FF15ACB04100) leading to 0041B0ACh.\n\nLooking deeper, I see that after the initial calls, there are series of instructions manipulating registers and moving data around. Maybe these are the points where the attacker can bypass checks by skipping certain instructions.\n\nSo potential bypass points could be:\n\n1. Skipping a conditional check before calling the target function.\n2. Hiding the call instruction within another operation to avoid detection.\n3. Overwriting registers or memory in a way that bypasses subsequent checks.\n\nFor each of these, I need to create patterns that can detect if an attacker is trying to use them and skip those instructions.\n\nLet me try to outline possible patterns:\n\n1. The first bypass could be after the initial call at 0040E7F6 where the attacker calls FF15ACB04100, then maybe skips a conditional check by manipulating EAX or something similar.\n2. Another point is right before the final call to 0041B0ACh. Maybe the attacker uses a conditional jump that's bypassed by setting certain flags in EAX.\n3. Perhaps inserting a different instruction after the initial call, like moving a value into EBP instead of using it for something else.\n\nWait, but I should look more carefully at each trace to find specific instructions where checks could be inserted or bypassed.\n\nIn TRACE #1:\n\n- There's an E8C8FFFFFF call which is 0x5555555F in hex. That might be a way to jump conditionally.\n- Then they pop EC, push F4, etc., but maybe those are just setup.\n\nLooking at the second instruction after E8C8FFFFFF: it's 0040E7FC which is FF7508. So that's pushing some data. Maybe the attacker uses this to set up a conditional jump elsewhere.\n\nIn another trace like TRACE #3:\n\n- The call at 00DAA9DC is E80D0C0000, then moves EAX and shrinks it.\n- Then they call FF15ACB04100 which is the target address. Maybe after that, there's a conditional jump or something.\n\nWait, maybe the attacker uses a conditional jump before calling the target function to skip certain checks. So if I can find an instruction like JE or JZ followed by the target call, then skipping that would bypass the check.\n\nLooking at the first trace:\n\nAfter E8C8FFFFFF is 0040E7FC which pushes FF7508 into [ebp+8]. Then they do some operations and push again before calling FF15ACB04100. Maybe there's a conditional jump after that, like JE or JZ.\n\nIf the attacker can bypass that conditional jump by setting EAX to match the condition, then execution would continue past it.\n\nSo possible bypass point 1: After pushing data into [ebp+8], skip a conditional jump instruction (like JE 0040E7C3h) by ensuring EAX matches the target.\n\nAnother bypass could be after popping some registers and before making the final call. Maybe they use a different offset or condition to bypass that check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an AND instruction right before calling the target function which is used for checks. If the attacker can modify EBP or another register to bypass it.\n\nI think I need to find specific instructions where the attacker could insert a conditional jump with a known condition and then skip it by manipulating registers.\n\nSo, let me try constructing some patterns:\n\n1. After pushing into [ebp+8], if there's a JE 0040E7C3h or JZ instruction that can be bypassed.\n2. Before the final call to 0041B0ACh, insert a conditional jump with an easily guessable condition.\n3. Maybe after some XOR operations, overwrite a register used in a check.\n\nFor each of these, I'll need to create a pattern that includes the target instruction and surrounding context bytes, using wildcards where necessary for address/offsets.\n\nI think three good bypass points could be:\n\n1. Skipping a JE or JZ before calling 0040E7C3h.\n2. Hiding the call within another instruction after pushing data into [ebp+8].\n3. Overwriting EBP with a value that makes subsequent conditional jumps ineffective.\n\nEach of these would require creating a Yara rule pattern for each bypass point, ensuring they are specific enough and cover different parts of the code to avoid being too broad.\n</think>\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation and the final answer:\n\n---\n\nTo create a bypass rule based on the provided traces, we identified three distinct points where an attacker might implement checks that can be bypassed. Each point targets a different instruction sequence to allow execution to continue past the detection mechanisms.\n\n### Bypass Points Identified:\n1. **Conditional Jump Around Call at 0040E7C3h**: After pushing data into [ebp+8], the attacker uses a conditional jump (JE or JZ) that can be bypassed by ensuring EAX matches the target address.\n2. **Hiding Target Call with Displacement**: The final call to 0041B0ACh is preceded by instructions where the attacker inserts an instruction using displacement to bypass the check without altering the program flow.\n3. **Overwriting Registers for Conditional Checks**: By setting a register value used in conditional jumps, the attacker can bypass subsequent checks before reaching them.\n\n### Yara Rules Constructed:\nEach rule targets one of these points with specific instructions and surrounding context bytes, ensuring wildcards are applied to address/offsets while keeping opcode and register encodings concrete.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass for conditional jumps and target calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF FF7508 FF40E7C3h }  # Skipping conditional jump\n        $pattern1 = { 6A5A 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF FF7508 FF40E7FFh }       # Hiding target call with displacement\n        $pattern2 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF FF7508 041B0ACh }      # Overwriting registers to bypass checks }\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThis rule captures three distinct bypass mechanisms used by the attacker, each designed to evade detection through conditional jumps or hidden instructions.",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a Yara rule based on the provided trace and apply adversarial analysis. Let's start by understanding what's happening in each trace.\n\nLooking at the traces from all three sandboxes (B, C, D), it seems that each has similar steps but some differences. The evasion tactics likely involve manipulating specific instructions to bypass detection.\n\nFrom Phase 1, as an attacker, I implemented checks like TEST EAX and JZX after certain calls or loads. My code also makes sure that displacement addresses are in specific ranges (0-254) and not using the stack unless necessary.\n\nNow, for the defender's perspective, I need to find where these checks can be bypassed without affecting legitimate execution.\n\nIn trace B, there's a TEST EAX 0x84 instruction. If this is skipped, any displacement check would fail because EAX wouldn't have been zeroed yet. So skipping TEST EAX could bypass the displacement check here.\n\nLooking at trace C, after the call to Service1, there's a JZX 0x25. If I skip this JZX before the next instruction (probably after some load), it would bypass that check without affecting legitimate code.\n\nIn trace D, right after calling Service2, there are two TEST instructions: one for EAX and another for AL. Skipping these TESTs would remove both checks, allowing displacement to be any value and AL not being zeroed, thus bypassing those guards.\n\nI should create patterns around these points where skipping an instruction can defeat the check.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule (Displacement and AL checks)\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
