Each trace has specific instructions that could be used as patterns for bypassing.\n\nLooking at the first few instructions in each trace:\n\n1. **Trace #1** starts with 85 C0 followed by a jump to E825050000, then test eax, etc.\n2. **Trace #2** has similar starting steps: 85 C0 and E825050000 again.\n3. **Trace #3** starts with FF7508 pushing into the stack and a call to E8C8FFFF.\n\nI need to create three patterns from these traces. Each pattern must be derived from consecutive instructions, include wildcards for offsets or addresses, and ensure each is 6-20 bytes long.\n\nLet me think about how to extract meaningful sequences:\n\n1. **Pattern 1**: From Trace #3, after pushing into the stack (FF7508) and calling E8C8FFFF, maybe combine these two instructions as a pattern.\n   - So, FF7508 would be replaced with ?? because it's an address or offset.\n   - The call instruction is 4 bytes: E8 C8 FFFF. If the offset in the call is unknown, we can replace it with ?? as well.\n\n2. **Pattern 2**: From Trace #1 and #2, after pushing EAX (5A), pop DX (6A), then push EB (BA040100) and call E874FAFFFF.\n   - The push and pop instructions are concrete, so they can be kept as is. However, the offset in the call might need wildcarding.\n\n3. **Pattern 3**: From Trace #2, after the initial steps of 85 C0 and E825050000, there's a mov instruction (E874FAFFFF) which can be part of the pattern if it appears in a context that allows bypassing.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for sequences where the same opcode is used with wildcards. For example, looking at call instructions:\n\n- In Trace #1 and #2: E8 25 05 00 00\n   - So, E8 (opcode) followed by four bytes which are address (25), then two zeros.\n   - Since the offset is known here, maybe it's better to keep them concrete. Alternatively, if it's a generic call, we can use wildcards.\n\nBut wait, in Yara, for a bypass rule targeting a call instruction, you'd typically include the entire 4-byte offset as a wildcard because it's variable.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nPattern 1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from Trace #3)\nPattern 2: 85 C0 followed by the target instruction and its context.\nPattern 3: Another sequence from another trace with similar structure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given good examples:\n\nGood Example 1:\n85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\n\nThis is combining multiple instructions into one pattern. So maybe each of my patterns should be a combination of consecutive instructions from the trace.\n\nLet me try to draft three patterns based on this structure:\n\n**Pattern 0**: From Trace #3:\nFF7508 (push) followed by E8C8FFFF (call). Since FF7508 is an address, we'll replace it with ??.\nSo Pattern 0: ?? C8 FFFF\n\nWait, but that's only four bytes. Need to make it at least six bytes. Maybe include the instruction before and after.\n\nLooking back at Trace #3:\n\n- Before FF7508, there are FF7508 (push) and then E8C8FFFF (call). Let me see if any surrounding instructions can be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take a longer sequence starting from when the target instruction is called. For example, after pushing into the stack, the call happens:\n\nThe pattern could be: FF7508 43 F4 ?? ????\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps each pattern should include more context to make it specific. So for Pattern 0, maybe combine the push and the call with some surrounding instructions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the entire instruction sequence from when the target is called. For example:\n\nIn Trace #3:\nBefore: FF7508 (push)\nThen: E8C8FFFF\n\nSo combining these as a single pattern would be 6 bytes: FF C8 FFFF ?? Wait, that's only five.\n\nWait, no. Let me count each part correctly. Each instruction in hex is two bytes, so:\n\nFF7508 is one instruction (two bytes), E8C8FFFF is four bytes? Wait, no, E8 is the opcode, then C8 FFFF are displacement and operand?\n\nWait, E8C8FFFF as a call instruction would be: E8 (opcode) followed by 4 bytes of offset. So in hex, it's 5 bytes: E8 C8 FF FF F0.\n\nBut if we're using wildcards for the address, maybe replace some parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps create patterns that target different parts of the trace to cover multiple traces.\n\nWait, the user needs exactly three patterns from the given trace data. So each pattern should be derived from one of the traces.\n\nSo let me think:\n\n- **Pattern 0**: From Trace #3: after pushing into the stack (FF7508) and making a call with E8C8FFFF.\n   - So FF7508 is replaced with ??, but since it's an address, we can use ?? to represent that part.\n\nBut how long should this pattern be? Let me try:\n\nPattern 0: ?? C8 FFFF\n\nWait, that's only four bytes. Need at least six.\n\nAlternatively, maybe include the instruction before FF7508. Before FF7508, in Trace #3, there are instructions pushing ebp and moving values.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on the call instruction itself.\n\nAnother approach: Each pattern is a specific sequence that can be found across different traces.\n\nLooking at Trace #1:\n85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nThis could be one pattern, combining these instructions with wildcards for the unknown parts after 0F 84.\n\nSimilarly, in Trace #2: same initial steps. So maybe Pattern 1 is similar to Pattern 0 but from another trace.\n\nBut since all traces have 85 C0 and then a call instruction, perhaps each pattern can be derived from these common starting points.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each pattern as targeting the same type of instruction (call) with different parameters. So:\n\nPattern 0: 85 C0 followed by some instructions leading to E825050000\nPattern 1: Same but from another trace\nPattern 2: Another variation\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, let me recall the example given in the validation error. The example was:\n\nGood Example:\n85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\n\nThis is combining 85C0, then 0F84 (which could be a test instruction), followed by some unknowns, and an 8B45 which is a mov instruction.\n\nSo perhaps each pattern should include multiple instructions leading up to the target.\n\nGiven that, let me try:\n\n**Pattern 0**: From Trace #3: After FF7508 push, E8C8FFFF call\nBut FF7508 and the displacement are both addresses. So we can replace them with ??.\n\nSo Pattern 0: ?? C8 FFFF\n\nBut that's only four bytes. Need at least six. Maybe include more instructions before or after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take a longer sequence:\n\nFor example, from when the target instruction is called:\n\nIn Trace #3:\nBefore E8C8FFFF (call), there are FF7508 (push) and 8B40A8 (mov). So perhaps combine these into one pattern.\n\nSo Pattern 0: ?? C8 FFFF\n\nBut again, only four bytes. Maybe expand to include the mov:\n\nPattern 0: ?? C8 FFFF 40 A8 ?? \n\nWait, that's eight bytes. Let me see if that fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take a different approach and combine more instructions from another trace.\n\nLooking at Trace #1:\nAfter E825050000 call, there are several XORs and movs. Maybe create a pattern targeting the call instruction with specific context.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to go back to the example given and structure each pattern similarly.\n\nSo let me try:\n\n**Pattern 0**: From Trace #3: After FF7508 (push) and E8C8FFFF (call)\nReplace FF7508 with ??, so Pattern 0 is: ?? C8 FFFF\n\nBut that's only four bytes. Maybe add the instruction before FF7508:\n\nBefore FF7508 in Trace #3:\nFF7508 (push) and then E8C8FFFF (call). So perhaps create a pattern of FF 75 08 C8 FFFF, which is six bytes.\n\nWait, no. FF7508 is two bytes: FF75 followed by 08? No, wait, FF7508 is one instruction: push with offset 0x7508.\n\nSo as a hex sequence, it's 0xFF, 0x75, 0x08. So three bytes for the push.\n\nThen E8C8FFFF is five bytes (E8 C8 FF FF F0). But in Yara, to bypass a call, you need to replace the entire instruction with a skip or similar.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to create each pattern as follows:\n\n**Pattern 0**: Combine the push and call instructions:\nFF7508 (push) followed by E8C8FFFF (call)\nSo Pattern 0: FF 75 08 C8 FFFF\n\nWait, that's six bytes.\n\nBut wait, FF7508 is three bytes: FF, 75, 08. Then E8C8FFFF is five bytes: E8, C8, FF, FF, F0. So combining them would make an 8-byte pattern, which is longer than needed but acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just take the call instruction and replace parts with wildcards:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut that's only four bytes, so not enough. Maybe include the following instruction to make it six bytes: E8 C8 FFFF ?? ?\n\nWait, in Trace #3 after E8C8FFFF is 0041B0ACh.\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 0 includes E8C8FFFF and then 0041B0AC:\n\nE8 C8 FFFF 00 41 B0 AC\n\nBut that's eight bytes. Alternatively, maybe only take the call instruction with a wildcard for displacement.\n\nAlternatively, use the example pattern provided in the validation error as inspiration.\n\nAnother approach: Each pattern should be derived from the same instruction sequence but with different offsets or opcodes where known.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create patterns based on the same opcode sequences but varying unknown parts. For example:\n\nPattern 0: E8 25 05 00 00 (from Trace #1 and #2)\nBut that's a specific call instruction, so not using wildcards. Instead, we need to replace known bytes with ?? where applicable.\n\nWait, in the example given, some parts are kept concrete:\n\nGood Example: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??\n\nHere, 85C0 is kept concrete, then a test instruction (0F84), followed by unknowns, and then a mov instruction.\n\nSo maybe each of my patterns should include some known instructions followed by wildcards where the bypass occurs.\n\nLet me try to create three such patterns based on different traces:\n\n**Pattern 0**: From Trace #3:\nAfter pushing into the stack (FF7508) and making a call with displacement C8 FFFF, so Pattern 0 could be: FF 75 08 C8 FFFF\n\nBut that's six bytes.\n\nWait, no. FF7508 is three bytes: FF, 75, 08. Then the call instruction is five bytes: E8, C8, FF, FF, F0. So combining would be eight bytes, which might be too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take just the call part with wildcards for displacement and operand:\n\nE8 ?? ??\n\nBut that's only four bytes. To make it six, perhaps include more instructions before or after.\n\nWait, in Trace #3, after the call (E8C8FFFF), there is a xor on the ebp-04h. So maybe Pattern 0 could be E8 C8 FFFF followed by 5A 8B.\n\nBut that's four bytes plus two more: total of six.\n\nSo Pattern 0: E8 C8 FFFF 5A 8B\n\nThat's six bytes, keeping the call and then some context.\n\n**Pattern 1**: From Trace #2:\nThe initial steps are similar to Trace #3 but without pushing into the stack. Instead, it's a push, pop, and so on.\n\nSo Pattern 1 could be: 5A 8B ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nBut wait, 5A is push ebp (E8 in hex?), no, 5A is part of the code. Wait, no, 5A is an operand byte.\n\nWait, looking back at Trace #2:\n\nAfter 0041E7F6: E84B167F000001C3 (call) ?? \n\nBut perhaps I'm getting confused with the hex representations.\n\nAlternatively, let's create a pattern based on the initial push and pop in Trace #2:\n\nAfter pushing ebp (5A), then pop, maybe followed by another push. So Pattern 1: 5A ?? ??\n\nWait, no. Let me think of specific steps.\n\nIn Trace #2:\nLine 0041E7F3: 8B EC (mov ebp, esp)\n0041E7F4: EB 03 (push ebp)\n\nSo after these two instructions, the next is a call to E84B167F. So maybe Pattern 1 could be:\n\n5A (push ebp) followed by ?? (unknown displacement), then E84B167F.\n\nBut that's four bytes: 5A, ??, E8, ... Hmm, not enough.\n\nAlternatively, include more context after the call to make it six bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps take a longer sequence:\n\nAfter the call in Trace #2:\nE84B167F is called. Then, there are several XOR operations and movs. So maybe Pattern 1 includes that entire call plus some context.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck again. Maybe let's try to make each pattern based on combining known instructions with wildcards:\n\n**Pattern 0**: E8C8FFFF (call) followed by 5A8B\nSo: E8 C8 FFFF 5A 8B\n\nThat's six bytes.\n\n**Pattern 1**: From Trace #2:\nAfter the initial push and pop, there are movs. So maybe:\n\n5A EB ?? ?? ?? \n\nWait, 5A is push ebp (0x5A), then EB (0xBB) is push ebp+08h. Then ?? for displacement.\n\nBut that's four bytes: 5A, BB, ??, ??\n\nNot enough. Maybe add more instructions after the mov:\n\n5A EB 4B 04 01 00 \n\nWait, but I'm not sure about those opcodes. Alternatively, keep it simple by including known parts.\n\n**Pattern 1**: After push ebp (5A), push ebp+8h (EB), then ?? for displacement.\n\nSo: 5A EB ??\n\nBut that's only three bytes. Need to make six.\n\nPerhaps add two more instructions after the mov:\n\n5A EB 4B 04 01 00 \n\nThis would be six bytes, but I'm not sure if these opcodes are correct for the given trace.\n\n**Pattern 2**: From Trace #1:\nAfter E825050000 call, there's a mov to 0x41B0ACh. So maybe combine that with surrounding context:\n\nE8 25 05 00 00 (call) followed by some unknowns.\n\nBut wait, the instruction after the call is xor eax, eax in Trace #1.\n\nSo perhaps Pattern 2 could be E8C8FFFF followed by 4B04 and a few other bytes.\n\nE8 C8 FFFF 4B 04 ??\n\nAgain, not enough. Maybe add more instructions:\n\nE8 C8 FFFF 4B 04 5A 8B \n\nBut I'm not sure about the opcodes here.\n\nAlternatively, use the example pattern as inspiration and include known parts with wildcards where applicable.\n\nAnother approach: Each pattern should target a different part of the code. For example:\n\n- Pattern 0 targets the first call instruction in Trace #3\n- Pattern 1 targets the second call instruction (Trace #2)\n- Pattern 2 targets another part, perhaps a different opcode sequence\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nPerhaps it's better to create three patterns based on the initial steps of each trace:\n\n**Pattern 0**: From Trace #3: FF7508 C8 FFFF\nSix bytes: FF 75 08 C8 FFFF (but wait, FF7508 is three bytes, and then four more for the call displacement)\n\nWait, maybe it's too short. Maybe expand to include more instructions.\n\nAlternatively, use a different approach by combining multiple known steps with wildcards:\n\n**Pattern 0**: E825050000 (call) followed by test eax, etc.\nE8 25 05 00 00\n\nBut that's five bytes. Add a few more instructions.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck on how to structure each pattern correctly. Maybe it's better to look at the example provided and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn the Good Example:\n85 C0 (push ebp)\n0F 84 (test eax, etc.)\nThen ?? ?? ?? ?? followed by 8B 45 (mov)\n\nSo perhaps I can create three patterns each with a known start and then unknowns.\n\n**Pattern 0**: 85 C0 0F 84 followed by four wildcards and a mov.\nSo: 85 C0 0F 84 ??\n\nBut that's five bytes. Need to make it six, so add another byte:\n\n85 C0 0F 84 ??\n\nWait, maybe replace the last part with more wildcards.\n\nAlternatively, use the structure from the example but combine different known parts.\n\nI think I need to proceed step by step and create each pattern carefully, ensuring they are 6-20 bytes and include necessary context.\n</think>\n\nTo correct the bypass rule, three distinct patterns have been crafted based on the provided trace data. Each pattern is designed to be specific enough to match only the target locations while using wildcards for address or offset bytes as required.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific addresses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user correct their Yara bypass rule based on the provided trace data and validation errors. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial attempt, the user had three patterns, but they were too short (only 6 bytes each). The validation pointed out that each pattern must be between 6-20 bytes. So, I need to ensure each pattern is sufficiently long by combining more instructions.\n\nThe trace data shows multiple function calls and similar instruction sequences. For example, the first few traces have patterns like E8C8FFFFFF followed by specific arguments. These could serve as good bases for our bypass patterns since they're unique enough but also specific enough when combined with wildcards.\n\nNext, I need to apply wildcard principles where applicable. This means replacing address or offset bytes with '??'. For instance, in the call instruction, the offset is usually 0x04 after the opcode (E8). So, changing that to ?? would make it more generic but still specific enough for our rule.\n\nAlso, each pattern must be different from the others. I'll ensure that by varying the instructions or the operands used when combining them.\n\nFinally, formatting is crucial. Each hex sequence should have spaces between bytes and start with a '$'. The meta section needs to include the correct cape_options with bp0, bp1, etc., referencing our new patterns.\n\nPutting this all together, I'll craft three distinct patterns each 6-20 bytes long, incorporating wildcards where necessary, ensuring they target specific but unique points in the trace.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
