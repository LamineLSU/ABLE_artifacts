Also, the patterns didn't include enough context after the CALL instruction.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided, there are two traces where ExitProcess calls a function with E8C8FFFFFF and another with FF1564104100. I should create patterns that capture these instructions along with surrounding context to make them 6-20 bytes long.\n\nFor each pattern, I'll include the CALL instruction (E8 or FF) followed by four wildcard bytes for the offset, then a few more relevant instructions like push and pop operations, and finally the address or displacement. I need to ensure that each pattern is unique and captures different parts of the trace to cover various bypass scenarios.\n\nI also remember to replace all address/offset bytes with ?? as per the wildcard rules. Each pattern should be exactly 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions if necessary.\n\nNow, I'll construct three distinct patterns based on the trace data, making sure each is correctly formatted and includes the required wildcards.

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The goal is to bypass malware evasion by exploiting certain strategies that were effective before but didn't result in new signatures.\n\nFirst, looking at the evolution history, the first iteration hit a rule but didn't add any new signatures. So I need to think about why that happened and how to adjust the strategy next time.\n\nThe user provided some trace data with two executions of ExitProcess. The traces show specific instructions like call 00408FDEh and then some conditional calls. It seems like the bypass was trying to target these exit points but didn't find a new signature, meaning it might have hit the wrong location or had issues.\n\nFrom the strategic options:\n\n- Strategy A: Check early in the trace for CALL TEST EAX JE/JNE.\n- Strategy B: Check before the exit call with conditional logic.\n- Strategy C: Use specific techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection, but these are more advanced and might not be necessary here.\n\nSince previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, perhaps moving earlier in the trace (Strategy A) wasn't effective. Maybe there's a conditional before the exit that was missed. So Strategy B could be better next time.\n\nLooking at the traces, I can see patterns like call 00408FDEh followed by other calls. There might be conditions on the stack or in registers that were bypassed incorrectly previously. To target these, I need to create a pattern that matches these conditional checks before the exit.\n\nI'll look for specific instructions in the trace:\n\n- In both traces, after the call 00408FDEh, there's another call with offset 0x00041064. This might be a conditional call based on some register state.\n  \nSo I can create patterns that capture these conditions before the exit.\n\nNow, for each of the three patterns:\n\nPattern A: Match the first part where EAX is tested with JE/JNE. The trace shows mov edi, edi followed by push ebp and push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Then call 00408FDEh. Maybe after that, a conditional check on EAX.\n\nPattern B: Capture the conditional call before exit. The offset is specific (0x00041064), so it's exact.\n\nPattern C: Ensure there are no other issues by checking another possible point, maybe an RDTSC or CPUID instruction if they exist in the trace, but I don't see them here.\n\nPutting this together, each pattern should be 6-20 bytes, use exact hex values where possible, and include wildcards for addresses that might vary. I'll make sure each pattern is different to avoid duplicates.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe previous bypass attempt hit the correct trace location but didn't add new signatures because it likely matched an unintended part of the code. To improve, we identified potential conditional checks before exit calls in Strategy B and crafted specific patterns targeting these conditions.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**  \n- **CALL_TEST_JE:** Targeted early in the trace for a test on EAX with JE/JNE.\n- **CONDITIONAL_CHECK:** Captured a conditional call before the exit, using exact offset 0x41064.\n- **UNSPECIFIED_CHECK:** Included another check to ensure no other conditions were missed.\n\n**REASONING:**  \nThese patterns are designed to specifically target potential conditional checks and early exits, increasing the chance of bypass without matching unintended code locations.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeted conditional exit checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFFFF FF7508 FF1564104100 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n}\n\ncondition:\n    (any of the patterns match)\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The task is to bypass a piece of malware that's using ExitProcess or TerminateProcess with some conditional logic. \n\nFirst, looking at the original traces provided:\n\nTRACE #1:\n- The call sequence includes E8C8FFFFFF which is 0x55F000 in hex. This is a call instruction.\n- After that, there are push operations on ebp and dword ptr.\n\nTRACE #2:\n- Similar structure but ends with FF1564104100 instead of E8C8FFFFFF.\n\nFrom the evolution history, we see two rule hits without new signatures, which suggests that previous patterns matched but didn't effectively bypass because they were either too broad or in the wrong location.\n\nThe STRATEGY A is to check for a JE/JNE instruction early on. Strategy B looks before the exit call. Since both attempts hit but didn't find new signatures, maybe the issue was with where the pattern was applied. \n\nIn the original trace, after the push instructions and before the call, there's E8C8FFFFFF (0x55F000). This is a call instruction to an unknown address F0h. But in Strategy A, we're looking for a JE or JNE instruction to test the exit condition.\n\nLooking at the traces, I don't see any JE/JNE instructions before 00409011. So maybe Strategy A isn't working because there's no such instruction early on.\n\nFor Strategy B, checking before the exit call is more promising. In both traces, after pushing ebp and dword ptr, we have E8C8FFFFFF (call F0h) followed by pop ecx and another push. Before that, perhaps the conditional logic exists.\n\nIn the first trace:\n- After 59 pop ecx comes FF7508 again.\n- Then FF1564104100 calls dword ptr [00411064h].\n\nLooking at these instructions, maybe there's a conditional before that. Since we don't see JE/JNE in Strategy A, perhaps using the call as the bypass point could work.\n\nBut since the previous attempts didn't get any new signatures, I think moving to more specific patterns might help. For example, looking for a specific sequence of calls or conditions that trigger program termination.\n\nConsidering the critical requirement that all patterns must come from the trace and use exact hex values, perhaps capturing the call to an unknown address (F0h) could be effective because it's unique and harder for the malware to defend against.\n\nSo, creating three distinct 6-byte patterns:\n\n1. Pattern A: The call to F0h followed by specific push operations.\n2. Pattern B: Conditional checks before the exit call.\n3. Pattern C: Unique instruction sequences that bypass the exit.\n\nEach pattern should be specific enough to match only at the correct location and use wildcards where necessary for address/offsets.\n\nNow, constructing each pattern:\n\nPattern A:\n- The call is 0x55F000 (E8C8FFFFFF in hex). Then, after push ebp and dword ptr, we have FF7508 twice. So the sequence would be: mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; 0x7508 push; 0x7508 push.\n\nPattern B:\n- Maybe a specific instruction before the exit call, like a cmp and je. For example, after pushing, we have E8C8F0 (call F0h), then pop ecx, FF7508 again, etc.\n\nPattern C:\n- A unique combination of instructions that bypasses both the call and conditional checks.\n\nBy making each pattern specific with exact hex values from the trace, they should trigger only at the intended exit points without matching elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts focused on general patterns which matched but didn't specifically target the correct execution path. By creating more specific 6-byte patterns that match only the exact locations where the bypass occurs and using known instructions from the trace, we increase specificity to avoid false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL CHECK, conditional checks before exit\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: Using specific hex values ensures matches are at correct execution points. Each pattern captures unique instruction sequences that bypass the exit process effectively without matching elsewhere in the code.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with specific patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 FF7508 FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B45 FC 55 F0 0x7508 0x7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 FF7508 E8C8F0 }\n    condition:\n        (any of the patterns match)\n}\n```",
