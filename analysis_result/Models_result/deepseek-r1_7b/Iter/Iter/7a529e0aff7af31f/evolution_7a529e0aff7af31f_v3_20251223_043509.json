      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help analyze this malware's evasion techniques by looking at the provided trace data. The goal is to find vulnerabilities that the attacker exploited and then suggest ways a defender can bypass them.\n\nFirst, let me look at the three traces given. They all end with similar calls, like E8C8FFFFFF and FF15ACB04100. That seems significant. In each trace, there are calls before these that might be guards or checks the malware is trying to bypass.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, I see a call at 003D667Fh which leads to the code around line 003D61F8. The code after that does some XOR and movs, then jumps conditionally. There are several conditional jumps using JE and JZ.\n\nIn TRACE #2 and #3, the call is at 0040E7C3h, which leads to a different address, but I notice similar structures with calls followed by conditional jumps or moves.\n\nThe attacker's strategy seems to be: after calling some function (like E8C8FFFFFF), they check if certain conditions are met before proceeding. For example, the code uses JE 003D5E83h and JZ 003D61F7h, which probably checks if EAX is zero or not.\n\nSo, the attacker might be trying to bypass these jumps by ensuring the conditions aren't triggered. If those checks are skipped (like if EAX isn't zero), the code continues executing instead of exiting early.\n\nNow, thinking from a defender's perspective, how can they bypass these checks? They'd need to find points where the condition is not met so that the jump doesn't occur or skips over it.\n\nPossible bypass points could be after the JE 003D5E83h and before the JZ. The attacker might have set EAX to a non-zero value just before the call, but if the code can somehow change EAX without being detected, that would bypass the check.\n\nAnother point is right after the call instruction itself. If the caller doesn't provide an offset or misaligns the jump, it could cause the condition to fail. Also, using wildcards where address offsets are might help skip these checks because the conditions rely on specific addresses.\n\nI should identify three distinct points in the trace where the attacker's checks can be bypassed. Maybe one after the first call, another after the second, and a third after the third. Each of these would form different patterns that the defender could use to continue execution beyond what the attacker expects.\n\nFor each pattern, I'll need to include enough context around the target instruction so it's specific but not too long. Using wildcards for address or offset bytes ensures that any specific addresses aren't matched unless intentionally bypassed.\n</think>\n\nHere are three distinct patterns based on the analysis of the evasion techniques and possible bypass points:\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionBypass {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting memory jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BEC5A8BFF C8 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFFFF 4157FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF }\n        $pattern2 = { FF15ACB04100 4163FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. The goal is to improve upon the existing strategies by using specific patterns from the trace data.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided trace, I notice several places where a TEST EAX followed by JE or JNE occurs. These are classic entry points for evasions because they check if certain conditions are met before proceeding. In the first strategy (Strategy A), these patterns are used to bypass early in the trace. However, previous attempts didn't find new signatures, so maybe we need to look a bit further.\n\nIn the second attempt, Strategy B was considered but failed as well. It seems that the exit decision wasn't being targeted properly. The third strategy involves using specific instructions like RDTSC or CPUID, which are less common and might not be present in all samples.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\n- At 003D617A: TEST EAX (85C0) is followed by JE (7412), suggesting a possible bypass point here.\n- At 003D61F0: Another TEST EAX with JEE8. This might be another target.\n\nI also notice that the call at 003D6190h could be an exit decision, but it's followed by more instructions which might complicate things.\n\nTo make the rule specific yet effective:\n\n1. Use the first TEST EAX (003D617A) with JE/JNE. This is a direct entry point check and should bypass early if the condition isn't met.\n2. Use the second TEST EAX at 003D61F0, which might be more specific to certain malware variants.\n3. Include an instruction like RDTSC or CPUID for added specificity in cases where the first two patterns don't work.\n\nThis way, we cover different points in the trace and increase the chances of bypassing without relying on a single pattern that may not always apply.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts focused on earlier parts of the trace but didn't find new signatures. By targeting more specific later points (like TEST EAX followed by JE) and adding additional checks, we can create a more reliable bypass rule.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: Using specific TEST EAX patterns from the trace increases specificity. Including an RDTSC adds an extra layer for evasion.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with more specific checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 12 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F F9 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user create an improved Yara bypass rule based on their provided trace and previous attempts. Let me start by understanding what they've done so far.\n\nFrom the history, it looks like they tried two strategies: looking at the first 30% of the trace for a CALL TEST EAX JE pattern (Strategy A) and then checking before the exit process (Strategy B). Both times, the rule hit but no new signatures were found. That suggests that either the patterns matched in the wrong location or didn't account for some specific conditions.\n\nLooking at their original trace data, there are two traces: #1 exits via ExitProcess with several calls and jmps, and #2 does something else before exiting. \n\nThe user provided a detailed example of Strategy A and C, but since both attempts failed to find new signatures, they need more specific patterns that hit the target without matching elsewhere.\n\nI remember from their initial analysis that the bypass point should be where the decision is made, not just the action. So maybe I should focus on earlier parts of the trace or conditional checks before exits.\n\nLooking at Trace #1, there's a lot of calls and jmps. Maybe Strategy A was too broad in the first 30%. Perhaps they need to look for more specific instruction sequences that trigger the exit decision, like checking if ESI is beyond certain values or using CPUID instructions which are often used by anti-malware tools.\n\nAlso, from their example patterns, they included specific hex bytes. So I should extract exact sequences from the trace without inventing anything.\n\nIn Strategy A, the initial pattern was a 6-byte sequence: {85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC}. Maybe this is too broad or didn't account for variations like different offsets. I can try to make it more specific by using concrete values where possible.\n\nFor Strategy B, the exit process might have conditions based on ESI, DWO, or CPUID instructions. Since they tried before the exit but failed, maybe focusing on these areas could help.\n\nI should create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns that target these decision points without being too broad. Let's see:\n\n1. A pattern looking for a conditional check using CPUID, like after an add and xor instruction.\n2. Another pattern checking ESI beyond a certain value to decide exit.\n3. Maybe something with RDTSC timing or stack manipulation if it appears.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is specific enough to hit the intended target but broad enough to avoid false positives by using exact hex values where possible and wildcards for varying parts like offsets.\n\nLet me extract some sequences from Trace #1:\n\nLooking around 003D617A, there's an add eax, ebx (03C3) followed by mov on ESI (8BCE). Then later, after several calls, there are conditional jumps based on ESI and DWO.\n\nSo maybe Pattern 1 could be looking for a specific instruction sequence that sets up ESI beyond certain limits. For example, an add instruction before a jmp or JE.\n\nPattern 2 might check for CPUID instructions, which often precede exit decisions in anti-malware bypass attempts. So perhaps after an add and xor on ESI with a fixed value (003D617E: push 0000005Bh is RDI? No, that's pushing to EBP). Wait, maybe after some operations on ESI.\n\nPattern 3 could involve specific stack manipulation or timing checks using RDTSC.\n\nLet me try drafting the patterns based on these observations:\n\n1. After an add and xor with a fixed value (like 0x5B), check if ESI exceeds a certain threshold.\n2. A conditional jump after checking ESI > 03D6... something, followed by a JE or conditional move.\n3. Use specific RDTSC timing instructions to bypass based on time.\n\nWait, I need exact hex values where possible. From the trace:\n\nAt 003D617A: 03C3 (add eax, ebx)\nThen at 003D617C: push 0000005Bh → that's RDI? Maybe not.\n\nBut looking for a sequence like add eax, [ebp-04], xor with something. Alternatively, maybe after some calls and jumps, there's a conditional on ESI or DWO.\n\nAnother idea: After an add ESI, ebp (maybe 03C1?), then checking if ESI > some value before calling something else to bypass exit.\n\nAlternatively, using CPUID instructions like sub eax, 0x4F52 (RDI) and then checking a condition based on that.\n\nHmm. I'll try to construct three specific patterns targeting these areas:\n\nPattern 1: Conditional check after an add and xor with known operands.\nPattern 2: Using CPUID instruction followed by conditional checks.\nPattern 3: Stack manipulation or timing-based bypass using RDTSC.\n\nEach pattern should be 6-20 bytes, extracted from the trace, with wildcards where necessary to avoid false positives.\n\nI think I can now draft these patterns and make sure they're specific enough but not too broad. Then, create a Yara rule that skips these bypass points.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**\nThe previous attempts failed because the patterns matched at locations other than the intended exit decision points.
