step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all suspicious instructions**\nScan the trace and list every instruction that could be part of the evasion:\n- Conditional jumps (JE, JNE, JZ, JNZ, etc.)\n- Test/compare instructions (TEST, CMP)\n- Function calls (CALL)\n- The exit point\n\n**Step 2: Trace the exit path backwards**\nStarting from the exit, trace backwards to understand:\n- What instruction directly causes the exit?\n- What conditional jump led to that path?\n- What check determined that jump's direction?\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 different bypass candidates**\nChoose 3 DIFFERENT instructions that, if skipped, could bypass the evasion.\n\n**Step 4: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\nFor each candidate, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions to create a specific pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Apply wildcards and generate the YARA rule**\nReplace address/offset bytes with ?? and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a YARA rule for this malware sample. Let's see, the user provided two traces from the disassembler, one before and after an exit point. My task is to find evasive instructions, trace back their path, pick three bypass candidates, build patterns, and then form a wildcards rule.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the trace data carefully. The first trace seems to be part of the initial execution leading up to the exit, while the second trace is after the function has been called or after some evasive steps. \n\nI notice that both traces have a lot of similar instructions: pushes, pops, calls, and memory accesses with LEA (which is like a double pointer). There's also a lot of JZ jumps, which are conditional jumps based on zero flags.\n\nHmm, the exit seems to be triggered by some function call. Looking at the first trace, I see an E8740A00 instruction being called twice, and then it exits with FFD0 calls. So maybe that's part of a bypassed path? \n\nI remember from previous knowledge that JZ (jump if zero) is often used in evasions because it only jumps when the condition isn't met. So perhaps there are multiple JZ instructions before these function calls.\n\nLet me think about how to reverse engineer this. If the trace shows the code after bypass, I need to find where the call happens and what leads up to it. It looks like the function being called is at 0A18h, which might be a memory address used by LEA instructions earlier on.\n\nSo maybe the path goes: JZ -> push some registers (like ESI, EDI, etc.) -> call that function from memory. If I can find where the JZ jumps to the function call instead of taking other paths, that's the bypass.\n\nLooking at the trace, there are multiple LEA instructions before the calls. Maybe these are used to load certain values into registers for comparison later on.\n\nI need to pick three different points in this code path where a conditional jump (like JZ) could be bypassed by skipping some bytes. Each of these would form my patterns.\n\nFor example, one possible JZ might be before the first LEA instruction. If that JZ is skipped, it changes the flow after pushing registers and calls the function. Then another JZ later in the code can be bypassed similarly, maybe a third time to ensure all paths are covered or another part of the code.\n\nWait, each pattern needs to include 2-3 instructions around the target instruction plus any wildcards for addresses and offsets. So I'll have to reconstruct what each byte looks like in hex based on the disassembler output.\n\nLet me try to outline one potential pattern: \n\nSuppose there's a JZ instruction at some point, say line X. The bytes before would include the JZ opcode (0x73 0x5A), then any operands or next instructions that depend on it. If I can find where the JZX is followed by something like push ESI, then call 0A18h.\n\nSo a possible pattern could be:\nJZ [some address] (opcode) -> push ESI (maybe some bytes) -> call (memory address)\n\nIf I replace all addresses with ?? and keep opcodes concrete, it would look like:\n\n73 5A ?? ... ??\n\nWait, but each instruction is four bytes. So maybe the JZ is followed by a PSH or something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the trace, after some pushes, there's an E8740A00 call which is being made twice before exiting. Maybe that function calls another routine that triggers a JZ.\n\nAnother approach: look for where the exit occurs and see what led to it. The second trace shows several calls leading up to FFD0, so maybe those are the main evasive steps.\n\nI think I need to focus on three distinct JZ instructions in the code path before the function call that could be bypassed.\n\nLet me try to extract possible patterns:\n\n1. First JZ: Suppose at some point there's a JZX instruction (maybe not exact, but looking for conditional jumps). Before it, there are pushes and maybe a test or compare after.\n\n2. Second JZ: Further along the code, another JZY could be used.\n\n3. Third JZ: Perhaps near where the function is called, to ensure all dependencies are met.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure of each step, this might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, looking for where memory addresses and pushes happen before the calls:\n\nThe LEA instructions (like 8DB0A00C) load values into registers. If these are followed by JZ that depend on certain conditions, bypassing them would change control flow.\n\nSo maybe each pattern includes a series of pushes, a LEA, then a conditional jump to skip to the function call.\n\nPutting it all together, I can draft three different patterns:\n\nPattern 1: JZX (followed by some bytes) -> PSH ESI -> PSH EDI -> TEST ... -> JZ something -> call.\n\nBut since each instruction is four bytes, maybe combining JZX with the next push would make a pattern of 8-12 bytes. Replacing addresses and offsets with ?? where applicable.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating this. Let's consider that in the code trace:\n\nLooking at the first trace after the initial steps, there are multiple JZ instructions before E8740A00 is called twice. Each of these could be potential bypass points.\n\nSo perhaps each pattern will involve a JZX followed by some pushes and then a call.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure without knowing exactly where each instruction falls in the byte stream. Maybe it's better to look for specific sequences.\n\nAnother idea: The function being called is at 0A18h, so LEA ESI, [0A18h]. So before that, there are some pushes which set up registers. If I can bypass those pushes by skipping over them, the JZ could jump directly to the function call.\n\nSo for each pattern, it's about finding where a conditional jump leads into pushing registers and then calling 0A18h. Each time, replacing the address or offset with ?? wherever applicable.\n\nPutting this together, I can create three distinct patterns:\n\nPattern 0: JZX (leaving some value) -> PSH ESI -> PSH EDI -> TEST ... -> JZ something -> call.\n\nBut since each instruction is four bytes, combining them would give a pattern of around 8-12 bytes. Replacing addresses with ?? where needed.\n\nSimilarly for Patterns 1 and 2, finding different JZX points to bypass before the function calls.\n</think>\n\nTo create YARA rules for bypassing the given evasive instructions, we need to identify three distinct conditional jumps (JZX) that can be bypassed by skipping their execution. Each pattern will combine the target instruction with surrounding context instructions and apply wildcards where applicable.\n\n### Patterns:\n\n1. **Pattern 0**: Includes a JZX followed by pushing ESI and EDI registers, then a TEST instruction, another JZX, and finally the function call.\n2. **Pattern 1**: Contains an earlier JZX before any pushes, leading directly to the function call after skipping the subsequent instructions.\n3. **Pattern 2**: Focuses on a later conditional jump (JZX) that bypasses more steps but still leads to the same function call.\n\nEach pattern is constructed by combining relevant bytes from the disassembled code and replacing address/offset bytes with `??`.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass: JZ jumps before function calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            0x735A,\n            0x4D,\n            ??,\n            0x5E,\n            ??:,\n            0x89,\n            0x5F,\n            0x12\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            0x735A,\n            ??:,\n            0x4D,\n            ??:,\n            0x6A,\n            ??,\n            0x36,\n            0x8B\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            0x735A,\n            ??:,\n            0x4D,\n            ??,\n            0x6A,\n            ??,\n            0x36,\n            0x8B\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

step:\n\n**Step 1: Identify all suspicious instructions**\nScan the trace and list every instruction that could be part of the evasion:\n- Conditional jumps (JE, JNE, JZ, JNZ, etc.)\n- Test/compare instructions (TEST, CMP)\n- Function calls (CALL)\n- The exit point\n\n**Step 2: Trace the exit path backwards**\nStarting from the exit, trace backwards to understand:\n- What instruction directly causes the exit?\n- What conditional jump led to that path?\n- What check determined that jump's direction?\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 different bypass candidates**\nChoose 3 DIFFERENT instructions that, if skipped, could bypass the evasion.\n\n**Step 4: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\nFor each candidate, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions to create a specific pattern.\n\n**Step 5: Apply wildcards and generate the YARA rule**\nReplace address/offset bytes with ?? and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to create a bypass rule for this given trace. Okay, first step is to identify all suspicious instructions. Looking through the trace, I see lots of call and jump instructions like E8740A00 which probably calls an evasion function. Then there are conditional jumps like JZ and JE that might be controlling the flow based on some checks.\n\nNext, I need to trace backwards from the exit point to understand how it's called. The exit seems to happen after a call to 0041EAD7h, which is probably where the bypass code should target. So, the last few instructions before exit are pushing onto the stack and then calling that function.\n\nNow, I need to pick three different bypass candidates. Let's see... Maybe one could be replacing the conditional jump instruction like JZ or JE with a skip, so we can bypass it without changing anything else. Then another candidate might involve skipping over a call instruction by modifying its offset bytes. And maybe the third one involves bypassing a memory access or a test instruction.\n\nEach pattern needs to combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into a hex sequence. I'll have to make sure each pattern is exactly between 6 and 20 bytes long, replacing all address/offset bytes with ?? as per wildcard rules. Also, keeping op codes and register encodings concrete.\n\nWait, for the first candidate, maybe around the conditional jump. Let's say instead of JZ with some condition, we just skip it by using a no-op or something. But since YARA uses wildcards, probably replace all address bytes in that area.\n\nFor the second pattern, perhaps bypassing a call instruction without changing anything else, so the offset is already correct but we can make it a wildcard to allow any offset.\n\nThe third could involve a test instruction like TEST EAX and then JZ or JE. So if we skip that part, maybe by replacing the conditional jump bytes with ??.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and fits within 6-20 bytes. Let me draft some possible patterns:\n\n1. Around the last JZ before the call: JZ ??. Maybe combining it with the next instruction which pushes ESI.\n2. The call instruction itself, replacing its offset with ?? since it's already correct but we can make it more flexible.\n3. Test and jump after the TEST instruction.\n\nI think I have three distinct patterns now that each target different points in the code flow. Each will include wildcards for any address or displacement bytes so they're bypassable regardless of what's there.\n\nFinally, including these as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2 with the correct hex sequences and ensuring each is 6-20 bytes long.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting conditional jumps and call instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 74 ?? ??.8B ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
