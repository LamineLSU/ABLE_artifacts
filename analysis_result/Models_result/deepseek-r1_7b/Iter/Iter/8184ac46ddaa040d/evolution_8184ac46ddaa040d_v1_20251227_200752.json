      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help fix the Yara rule for the given malware evasion bypass issue. The user provided a lot of information, including the trace data and some initial attempts at creating a rule that's too short.\n\nFirst, I notice that in the original task, the pattern length is only 5 bytes, which is below the required minimum of 6-20 bytes. So, my goal is to extend each pattern to meet this requirement by adding more instructions from the trace data around the target code.\n\nLooking at the trace data, the exit process happens after several function calls and jumps. I need to identify sequences that could potentially bypass these checks. For example, in one of the traces, there's a call to E8C7F0FEFFFFh which is a specific address. Maybe if this instruction is skipped or altered, it would cause an evasion.\n\nI also remember from the user’s previous attempt that they tried to use patterns like 6A5BE82505000E825 and so on but found them too short. So, I'll need to expand each pattern by including more instructions before or after these addresses to make sure each is at least 6 bytes long.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the use of wildcards for address/offset bytes as per Yara's rules. This means replacing any raw hexadecimal value that represents an address with '??' to indicate it can be bypassed. However, I have to keep opcode and register-encoding bytes concrete because those are necessary for matching.\n\nI should also ensure that each pattern is unique and doesn't repeat the same sequence from the trace data to avoid false positives. Each of the three patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2) must come from different parts of the traces provided.\n\nLet me start by identifying possible sequences around the target calls:\n\n1. In the first trace (TRACE #1), there's a call at E8C7F0FEFFFFh which is 5 bytes long. To make it 6-20 bytes, I can include the instruction before and after this call.\n2. Similarly, in other traces like TRACE #2, there are calls at different addresses that could form separate patterns.\n3. I'll need to combine these instructions with their surrounding context to create each pattern.\n\nI should also check for any conditional jumps or tests that might precede these calls because bypassing them is crucial for the evasion.\n\nLet me draft some possible patterns:\n\n- For $pattern0: Maybe start from a test instruction, then move to the call address. So something like TEST EAX, then the call.\n- For $pattern1: Another part of the code where a different instruction leads into a bypassable point.\n- For $pattern2: A third unique sequence that can be targeted.\n\nI have to ensure each pattern is wrapped in { } with spaces between hex bytes and replaced address bytes with '??'. Also, keep op codes and registers concrete.\n\nAfter creating these patterns, I'll need to include them in the meta section under strings as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2. Then, in the cape_options, reference each pattern plus the offset byte (like +0) for each.\n\nI should also double-check that all three patterns are different and meet the 6-20 byte requirement.\n</think>\n\n```\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 00 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct the Yara rule based on the given trace data and validation errors. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user provided a previous incorrect Yara rule that failed validation because each pattern was too short (4 bytes) instead of at least 6. The task is to generate a corrected rule with three patterns, each between 6-20 bytes long. Additionally, all address/offset bytes must be replaced with wildcards (??), and the rules should come directly from the provided trace data.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the trace data for each of the five traces. The goal is to identify potential bypass paths by looking at function calls that could be skipped or bypassed.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1:\n- There are several function calls like E825050000 (call dword ptr [ebp-04h]) and E874FAFFFF (call 00C71700h).\n- The pattern around these could be used to create bypass rules.\n\nFor each trace, I'll identify three different patterns that can cause an evasion by skipping the check or jumping directly.\n\nLet me start constructing patterns:\n\n1. From TRACE #1, look for a call instruction and surround it with nearby instructions.\n2. Another pattern might involve a conditional jump (like JZ) before a test.\n3. A third pattern could be around a function call that's followed by certain operations.\n\nWait, I need to ensure each pattern is derived from the trace data without adding new sequences. So I'll look for consecutive instruction bytes in the trace and replace address/offsets with ??.\n\nLet me try creating three distinct patterns:\n\nPattern 1: Around E825050000 (call dword ptr [ebp-04h])\nThis could be represented as:\nE8 ??\n??\n?? ?? \nThen the call instruction, followed by some bytes.\nBut wait, I need to include specific context. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the trace, after E825050000 (call dword ptr [ebp-04h]), the next instruction is 85C0. So perhaps combining E8 and the following bytes.\n\nWait, let me check the exact sequence:\nE825050000\nThen 85C0 (test eax, eax), followed by some operations.\n\nSo a possible pattern could be: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nPattern 1: { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nBut need to ensure it's at least 6 bytes. This is 7 bytes including the E8 and five more. Okay.\n\nPattern 2: Around a conditional jump followed by a test.\nLooking at another part of the trace, like JZ or JE.\n\nIn TRACE #1, after some calls and jumps, there's a TEST instruction preceded by a conditional. Maybe something like:\n0F84 (cmp eax, 04h), then 7407 (je 0F83h). So combining these:\n\nPattern could be: 0F 84 ?? 74 ?? ??\n\nBut need to include enough bytes around.\n\nWait, the exact sequence is:\n0F84 (cmp eax, 04h)\n7407 (je 0F83h)\n\nSo maybe combine with surrounding instructions like E825 and then the test and jump.\n\nAlternatively, take a few bytes before and after. Maybe:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? 74 ??\n\nBut that's too long. Alternatively, focus on just the relevant part: 0F84 followed by 7410 (je ...). Wait, in TRACE #1, it's 7412.\n\nWait, looking back:\nIn TRACE #1, after E825..., there's a line: 7412 (je 01C5h).\n\nSo the sequence is: E825... then 7412.\n\nBut to create a pattern that includes this, perhaps take the E8 instruction and surrounding bytes.\n\nAlternatively, use another part of the trace where a function call leads directly to an exit without checking. Maybe in TRACE #3 or #4.\n\nLooking at TRACE #3:\nIt has FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch]) which is after some steps.\n\nSo maybe create a pattern from that.\n\nAnother approach: pick three distinct function calls and their surrounding instructions to form the patterns.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\nThis would match when after a call, there's a test eax, eax (85C0).\n\nPattern 2: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE ??\nThis could be from another trace where after pushing, there's an instruction leading to a bypass.\n\nWait, in TRACE #1, after E825..., there's 85C0. So the function call is at E825... and then 85C0.\n\nBut maybe Pattern 2 can be something else, like a conditional jump followed by a test.\n\nLooking at another part of the trace, in TRACE #1: after some jumps, there's an 8BCE (mov ecx, esi) followed by E874F... call. So perhaps:\n\nPattern could be: 0F ?? ??? E8 ??\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe Pattern 2 is from another part.\n\nAlternatively, take a pattern that includes a function call and the following mov instruction.\n\nIn TRACE #1, after E825..., there's an 8BCE (mov ecx, esi). So perhaps:\n\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B CE\n\nBut I need to include enough bytes. Maybe combine with surrounding instructions.\n\nAlternatively, take the sequence from the call and the next few instructions.\n\nWait, in TRACE #1:\nE825050000 (call dword ptr [ebp-04h])\nThen E874F00000 (call 00C71700h)\nSo maybe a pattern of E8 ?? ??:00 ?? ?\n\nBut not sure.\n\nLet me try to structure the three patterns:\n\nPattern 1: Around the first call in TRACE #1.\nE825... could be represented as E8 followed by some bytes and then 85C0.\n\nWait, perhaps Pattern 1 is:\nE8 ??\n??\n?? ?? \nThen 85 C0\n\nSo { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nPattern 2: Another call in a different trace.\nLooking at TRACE #3, there's FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch]). Before that, some operations. Maybe combine with prior instructions.\n\nAlternatively, take the function call and surrounding context from another part.\n\nPattern 2: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut not enough bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for specific sequences:\n\nIn TRACE #4:\nFF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch])\nThis could be a pattern if it's preceded by certain instructions. Maybe combining with E8 before it.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to create patterns based on the exit path.\n\nWait, looking at the call in TRACE #5:\nFF152CA1C7F8 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch])\n\nSo maybe a pattern starting from that call and surrounding instructions.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach: create three distinct patterns based on different function calls, each at least 6 bytes long with wildcards.\n\nPattern 1:\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nPattern 2:\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? \n\nWait, from the first part of TRACE #4: 6A pushed, then 5A popped, then 8BCE (mov ecx, esi), followed by E8 near.\n\nSo combining these:\n\n6A ?? 5A ??:00 ?? ?\n\nBut maybe:\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ??\n\nThat's 7 bytes: { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\nPattern 3:\nLooking at another part, perhaps after a call to an offset, there's movement. For example:\n\nE874FAFFFF (call 01C712Ch)\nWhich is preceded by some jumps and tests.\n\nAlternatively, in TRACE #5: FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch])\n\nCombining with surrounding instructions: E8 ?? before it.\n\nBut to make sure each pattern is unique.\n\nSo final patterns:\n\nPattern 0: { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\nPattern 1: { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\nPattern 2: { 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ??? }\n\nWait, in the trace, after some calls and jumps, there's a TEST instruction (0F84) followed by a jump. So combining:\n\n74 ?? 0F 84 ?? \n\nBut need enough bytes.\n\nAlternatively, Pattern 2 could be: 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ?? ?\n\nBut let me think in terms of exact instructions from the trace.\n\nIn TRACE #1:\n- After some calls and jumps, there's a TEST instruction (0F84) followed by a jump to 0F83h.\nSo combining these with surrounding context: E8 ?? 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ??\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nPattern 2: { 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ??? }\n\nBut I need to ensure it's at least 6 bytes.\n\nAlternatively, take the test and jump as part of a longer sequence.\n\nAfter analyzing all this, here are three distinct patterns each derived from different parts of the trace data:\n\n1. Around E825050000 (call dword ptr [ebp-04h]) followed by 85C0:\n   { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n2. From a part where after pushing and popping, there's an instruction leading to a bypass:\n   { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\n3. Around the TEST and JUMP instructions:\n   { 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ??? }\n\nWait, but I need to make sure each pattern is exactly between 6-20 bytes.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nPattern 1: { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 } (7 bytes)\n\nPattern 2: { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? } (7 bytes)\n\nPattern 3: { 74 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? } (7 bytes, but need to include the jump destination)\nWait, in the trace, after 0F84 comes JZ or JE.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1:\n0F84 (cmp eax, 04h)\n7420 (je 0F83h)\n\nSo combining these: { 0F 84 ?? 74 ?? ??:0F }\n\nBut to make it a pattern of 6 bytes:\n\n{ 0F 84 ?? 74 ?? ??:0F } is too long.\n\nWait, perhaps take the test and jump together:\n0F84 followed by 7412 (je ...). So { 0F 84 74 12 }\n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. Add surrounding instructions to make it longer:\n\n{ 6A ?? 5A 8B CE 0F 84 74 ??:0F } ?\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, take the test and jump as part of a sequence with some context.\n\nAnother approach: use the call instruction from TRACE #3:\nE815ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00DDE13Ch])\n\nSo combining this with surrounding instructions:\n\n{ 6A ?? 5A E8 15 AC B0 ??: }\n\nBut not sure.\n\nI think I need to prioritize patterns that are more specific and derived directly from the trace data without adding new sequences. Let me define three distinct patterns as follows:\n\nPattern 0: Around a function call followed by TEST and JUMP:\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??:0F 84 ?? 74 ??\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use each function call in separate traces to form the patterns.\n\nFinal attempt:\n\n1. From TRACE #1's E825...: { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n2. From another part of TRACE #1: { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n3. From TRACE #4's FF call: { ??:0F 84 74 ?? ??? }\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nPattern 0:\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0\n\nPattern 1:\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ??\n\nPattern 2:\n74 ?? ??:0F 84 ??\n\nEach is at least 6 bytes.\n\nYes, that seems better.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 74 ?? ??:0F 84 ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
