The user provided a lot of trace data with different instructions and some calls that might be evasions. My goal is to figure out where the attacker inserted these evasions and then suggest how a defender could potentially bypass them.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace, I see several call instructions like FFD2 and 8B550C which probably are the evasion points because they're called during execution. The exit process happens at 0041E21F with an FFD0 call, but it's exiting early due to sandbox evasion.\n\nThinking from the attacker's perspective, they must have implemented some checks to detect if the code is running in a sandbox or VM. So their evasions are designed to bypass these checks. The key here is to identify which instructions trigger those checks and where the calls are made before exiting.\n\nNow, for each call instruction (like FFD2, 8B550C), I need to see what check they're trying to bypass. Maybe each call corresponds to a different guard condition. So, the attacker probably has three checks: one after each of these calls.\n\nFrom the defender's angle, I should look for places where the instructions could be skipped without affecting the program flow or bypassing the guards. Since the trace exits early, maybe certain jumps or conditions can be used to skip around these guard checks.\n\nLet me break down the evasions:\n\n1. The first call is FFD2 at 0041E1A4. Maybe it's checking for a certain instruction before execution.\n2. The second call is 8B550C at 0041E216, perhaps another guard condition further in the code.\n3. Then there's an exit at FFD0, which might be bypassing a final check.\n\nSo each of these calls could represent a guard against sandbox detection. To bypass them, the defender would need to skip over these instructions or manipulate their execution flow.\n\nFor creating patterns, I should combine 2-3 consecutive instructions around each call and include wildcards where necessary for address/offsets. Each pattern needs to be unique but fit within 6-20 bytes.\n\nWait, let me check if the example given by the user makes sense. They provided two examples: one with TEST EAX + JZ + MOV (11 bytes) and another with PUSH + POP etc. So each pattern is a sequence that includes the target instruction plus some context around it with wildcards for addresses.\n\nI need to make sure my patterns are specific enough but don't include any bytes that could be detected easily by analysis tools. Using wildcards where appropriate, like in address fields or offsets after opcodes.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern 0: Around FFD2 (0041E1A4). Maybe the instruction before and after with some context.\nPattern 1: Around 8B550C at 0041E216.\nPattern 2: The final exit call, perhaps including surrounding instructions.\n\nEach pattern should have different sequences to avoid overlap. I'll need to make sure each is unique but still captures the necessary context for bypassing.\n\nAlso, the patterns must be exactly 6-20 bytes long. So combining a few instructions with wildcards where applicable.\n\nI think that's about it. Now, time to write out three distinct patterns based on these thoughts.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for sandbox detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0041E1A3 ?? 0041E1A4 FFD2 ?? 0041E1A5 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 0041E216 8B550C ?? 0041E217 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 0041E21F FFD0 ?? 0041E220 ??.?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
