        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this Yara rule for bypassing an evasion. The user provided a trace and some incorrect code. Let me see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the invalid rule: it has meta with description and cape_options but no strings. Oh right, in the validation error, missing basic structure\u2014so I need to add the strings section with three patterns.\n\nThe instructions that could cause exit are all over, like call 0040E7C3h multiple times. The exit happens after a call, so maybe I can skip some steps before the call.\n\nLooking at the trace, each exit has E8 C8FFFFFF pushing to ebp+08h and then calling 0040E7C3h via EAX, then another push. So perhaps if any of those pushes or the instruction after call are skipped, it would bypass.\n\nI need three different patterns. Each should cover a path that leads to exit by skipping certain steps.\n\nFirst pattern: Maybe skip the initial mov and test before calling. So something like TEST EAX followed by JZ or JE, then skip pushing to ebp.\n\nSecond pattern: Skip the call itself but maybe keep some context around it, like after the push. Or perhaps replace the 0040E7C3h address with a wildcard.\n\nThird pattern: Maybe skip the second push and the next instruction, which is another push or something else leading into EAX.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards for addresses. Also, all opcodes and register bytes should be kept concrete.\n\nLet me try building them:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ/EAX + EAX (so skip the push) then call. So TEST, opcode, EAX, maybe a jump with offset as 40E7C3h replaced by ??.\n\nWait, but in Yara, we can't directly reference addresses like that. Instead, I should make sure the address is wildcarded. Maybe include the call instruction with its address as ??. So:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX+JZ[EAX+4]EAX+40E7C3h? Or maybe better to structure it as TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (so skip push) and then call.\n\nBut in Yara, the order is important. Let me think of each pattern as a sequence.\n\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??. This covers TEST EAX+JZ/EAX and skips pushing to ebp (8B45), then maybe moving something else with ??.\n\nWait, but the instruction after TEST would be JZ or JE. So perhaps the first pattern is TEST EAX followed by JZ[EAX], which skips the next push.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's exactly how it works. Alternatively, think of each pattern as a combination of instructions leading to the exit point when skipped.\n\nWait, maybe for each bypass, we can skip one of the steps before the call or after the call but within the same sequence.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern1: Skip pushing to ebp and moving something else after the call. So EAX+40E7C3h becomes ??, so 8B45 is replaced with ??.\n\nWait, let's try to structure each pattern as a combination of instructions that can be skipped or altered.\n\nFirst Pattern:\n- TEST EAX (opcode)\n- JZ/EAX (maybe JZ[EAX])\n- Then skip pushing to ebp and moving something else. So after the call, maybe another instruction is replaced.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe each pattern should cover a different part of the code before or after the call.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nPattern1: Skip the push to ebp (0040E7F0-55) by having 8B45 as ??, so EAX moves something else instead.\n\nPattern2: Skip the call instruction itself. So the instruction after the push is EAX+40E7C3h which becomes ??.\n\nPattern3: Skip a different step, like skip the second push (0040E7FC) by making that address ??.\n\nWait, but in Yara, each pattern must be specific enough. Maybe I can structure them as follows:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX+JZ[EAX] followed by 8B45 as ?? and maybe another instruction after the call.\n\nPattern2: 0F75E8 followed by ??. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each pattern as a sequence that leads to the exit when skipped. So:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ[EAX] (so skip pushing to ebp) then call (push dword ptr [ebp+08h] becomes ??).\n\nPattern2: 74?? followed by ??.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each instruction in the trace and see which ones can be skipped or altered.\n\nLooking back, after the initial mov edi, edi is pushed as esp, then ebp moved via 8BEC. Then push dword ptr [ebp+08h] (pushes to stack). Then call E7C3h (0040E7C3h) which is replaced with ??.\n\nSo each pattern could skip one of these steps:\n\n1. Skip the initial mov and test by having a JZ or JE before pushing.\n2. Skip the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h] by wildcarding that instruction's address.\n3. Skip the call E7C3h by making its address ??.\n\nSo let me try building each pattern accordingly.\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ[EAX+4] (so skip pushing) and then maybe another instruction like push something else.\n\nWait, in Yara, each pattern is a sequence of hex bytes. So:\n\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??. This could be TEST EAX+JZ[EAX] (using the JZ after TEST) and then skip pushing to ebp by making 8B45 as ??.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe it should include the next instruction after TEST, which is JZ or JE, then something else like a mov with wildcards.\n\nPattern2: Maybe replace the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h] (8B4F) with ??, so 74?? followed by another instruction.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each pattern as covering different steps:\n\n1. Skip after TEST EAX + JZ/EAX.\n2. Skip the call address itself.\n3. Skip a different push instruction before the call.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern0: Test and jump, then skip pushing to ebp.\nPattern1: Replace the call address with ??.\nPattern2: Skip another push instruction like 8B4F.\n\nLet me try writing them out with wildcards for addresses.\n\nPattern0:\n85 C0 (TEST EAX)\n?? ?? (JZ or JE after TEST)\nThen maybe a mov or something, but perhaps it's better to include the next instruction as well. So:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nWait, this might be too long.\n\nPattern1: Maybe skip the call by making its address wildcard:\nE8 ??: Let's see, EAX+40E7C3h becomes ??.\nBut I need to include leading instructions. So:\n\n$pattern1 = { 74 ?? (some conditional jump) followed by pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] as ?? }\n\nWait, maybe it's better to structure each pattern with a few bytes that can be skipped.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that after the call is another push instruction.\n\nSo Pattern2: After the call, skip the second push by making 8B4F as ??.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to look for wildcards in the trace and construct patterns based on that.\n\nWait, in the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h], that instruction is at 0040E7F3 (FF7508). So that's 0x00 0xFF 0x75 0x08. The address is ebp+08h, which in Yara can be represented as ??.\n\nSo Pattern1 could be: 8B4F as ??: 8B?? or something like that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPattern0: TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (skip push) and then another instruction with a wildcard.\nPattern1: Replace the call address (0040E7C3h) with ??.\nPattern2: Skip the second push dword ptr [ebp+08h] by making that address ??.\n\nI think I can structure them as follows, ensuring each is 6-20 bytes and has wildcards where needed.\n\nFinal Patterns:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??: This might be too long. Maybe better to break it into smaller chunks.\nWait, perhaps $pattern0 is TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (so skip pushing) and then a mov something else.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the first pattern can be TEST EAX followed by JZ, skipping the next push, then moving an instruction that's after the call with ??: \n\nSo: 85 C0 (TEST) + 0F 84 (JZ[EAX+4]) ?? ?? ... etc.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to make them as per the examples in the template.\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected Yara rule with three bypass patterns, each covering different steps before or after the call instruction:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description: \"Bypasses multiple evasion points\"\n        cape_options: \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **$pattern0:** Skips pushing to `ebp` by using wildcards for the address, effectively bypassing that step.\n\n2. **$pattern1:** Replaces a conditional instruction (74 ??) with another wildcarded address, bypassing subsequent instructions until the call is reached.\n\n3. **$pattern2:** Skipswrites and pushes to `ebp+08h` by making its address wildcarded, bypassing that step before the final call.",

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to correct the Yara rule based on the provided information. The task is to create a bypass rule for evasion targeting specific ExitProcess calls. \n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, there are two exit points at different addresses: 0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF. Both have similar call sequences leading into an EAX test with a conditional jump.\n\nI need to extract three distinct patterns from these traces. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offsets and keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nLooking at the first ExitProcess at 0040E7F6:\n- The call is E8C8FFFFFF, which is a call to 0040E7C3h.\n- Before that, there's an instruction FF15ACB04100, which seems like a dword ptr [0041B0ACh].\n\nSimilarly, the second ExitProcess at 0040E7FF has the same call sequence before the jump.\n\nI'll create three different patterns by combining these instructions with surrounding context. \n\nPattern 1: The first pattern could be just the call instruction and the next few bytes.\nPattern 2: Maybe include the EAX test and conditional jump.\nPattern 3: Another variation, perhaps including the dword ptr instruction before the jump.\n\nI'll make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards where necessary. Also, ensure that all patterns are unique to avoid duplicates.\n\nFinally, I'll format the meta section with the correct cape_options, listing each pattern's offset as $patternX+0.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting fixed ExitProcess calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8C8FFFFFF 8B EC FF75 08 }\n        $pattern1 = { 8B EC FF75 08 FF15 AC B0 41 00 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF15 AC B0 41 00 8B EC FF75 08 E8 C8 FFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
