      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help analyze this malware trace data and come up with YARA bypass rules. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user provided two traces where ExitProcess was called at different addresses: 0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF. Both traces are similar but diverge slightly after that point. My task is to extract three patterns from these traces using specific instructions as examples.\n\nLooking at Trace #1, the call happens at E8C8FFFFFF, which suggests a call with an offset. In the example pattern given, there's something about the offset and how it's handled. I need to replicate that but make sure each pattern is unique and fits within 6-20 bytes.\n\nFor Trace #2, another call occurs at FF15ACB04100. This seems similar but has a different offset structure. I should find two distinct patterns here as well.\n\nI remember the rules about using wildcards for address or displacement bytes and keeping opcode and register bytes concrete. So each pattern will include some wildcard placeholders where necessary, like ?? for unknown addresses or offsets.\n\nLet me think of possible instruction sequences that fit these traces:\n\n1. Maybe a call with an offset from the stack or memory.\n2. Another sequence involving similar instructions but with different displacements to make it unique.\n3. Perhaps another common bypass pattern using different instructions but still evading the detection.\n\nI also need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and doesn't repeat any of the others. I'll start drafting some hex patterns based on the provided trace data, making sure to replace address/offsets with ?? as per the rules.\n\nOnce I have three unique patterns, I can format them into YARA strings. Each string will represent a different bypass method targeting specific points in the code.\n\nI need to be careful not to make any assumptions that aren't supported by the trace data and ensure all instructions are correctly represented. Also, keeping the pattern lengths within the specified range is crucial for specificity.\n\nAfter drafting each pattern, I'll review them to confirm they meet all requirements: length, use of wildcards, concrete opcode/registers, uniqueness, and proper YARA formatting.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s a structured analysis based on the provided traces:\n\n1. **First Pattern**: Focuses on the call instruction with an offset from memory or stack.\n   - Example pattern: `8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8???F6 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45 ??`\n\n2. **Second Pattern**: Targets a different displacement for the offset, ensuring uniqueness.\n   - Example pattern: `8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8???F3 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? C0 ????`\n\n3. **Third Pattern**: Uses an alternative sequence while keeping opcode and registers concrete.\n   - Example pattern: `8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8???6C 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? 45 ??`\n\nEach pattern is designed to be specific enough (6-20 bytes) while incorporating wildcards where necessary and keeping concrete opcode and register encodings.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting call instructions with memory/displacement\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8???F6 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B45}\n        $pattern1 = {8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8???F3 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to fix this Yara rule for bypassing an evasion. The user provided a trace and some incorrect code. Let me see what's going on.\n\nFirst, looking at the invalid rule: it has meta with description and cape_options but no strings. Oh right, in the validation error, missing basic structure\u2014so I need to add the strings section with three patterns.\n\nThe instructions that could cause exit are all over, like call 0040E7C3h multiple times. The exit happens after a call, so maybe I can skip some steps before the call.\n\nLooking at the trace, each exit has E8 C8FFFFFF pushing to ebp+08h and then calling 0040E7C3h via EAX, then another push. So perhaps if any of those pushes or the instruction after call are skipped, it would bypass.\n\nI need three different patterns. Each should cover a path that leads to exit by skipping certain steps.\n\nFirst pattern: Maybe skip the initial mov and test before calling. So something like TEST EAX followed by JZ or JE, then skip pushing to ebp.\n\nSecond pattern: Skip the call itself but maybe keep some context around it, like after the push. Or perhaps replace the 0040E7C3h address with a wildcard.\n\nThird pattern: Maybe skip the second push and the next instruction, which is another push or something else leading into EAX.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards for addresses. Also, all opcodes and register bytes should be kept concrete.\n\nLet me try building them:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ/EAX + EAX (so skip the push) then call. So TEST, opcode, EAX, maybe a jump with offset as 40E7C3h replaced by ??.\n\nWait, but in Yara, we can't directly reference addresses like that. Instead, I should make sure the address is wildcarded. Maybe include the call instruction with its address as ??. So:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX+JZ[EAX+4]EAX+40E7C3h? Or maybe better to structure it as TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (so skip push) and then call.\n\nBut in Yara, the order is important. Let me think of each pattern as a sequence.\n\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??. This covers TEST EAX+JZ/EAX and skips pushing to ebp (8B45), then maybe moving something else with ??.\n\nWait, but the instruction after TEST would be JZ or JE. So perhaps the first pattern is TEST EAX followed by JZ[EAX], which skips the next push.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's exactly how it works. Alternatively, think of each pattern as a combination of instructions leading to the exit point when skipped.\n\nWait, maybe for each bypass, we can skip one of the steps before the call or after the call but within the same sequence.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern1: Skip pushing to ebp and moving something else after the call. So EAX+40E7C3h becomes ??, so 8B45 is replaced with ??.\n\nWait, let's try to structure each pattern as a combination of instructions that can be skipped or altered.\n\nFirst Pattern:\n- TEST EAX (opcode)\n- JZ/EAX (maybe JZ[EAX])\n- Then skip pushing to ebp and moving something else. So after the call, maybe another instruction is replaced.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe each pattern should cover a different part of the code before or after the call.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nPattern1: Skip the push to ebp (0040E7F0-55) by having 8B45 as ??, so EAX moves something else instead.\n\nPattern2: Skip the call instruction itself. So the instruction after the push is EAX+40E7C3h which becomes ??.\n\nPattern3: Skip a different step, like skip the second push (0040E7FC) by making that address ??.\n\nWait, but in Yara, each pattern must be specific enough. Maybe I can structure them as follows:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX+JZ[EAX] followed by 8B45 as ?? and maybe another instruction after the call.\n\nPattern2: 0F75E8 followed by ??. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each pattern as a sequence that leads to the exit when skipped. So:\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ[EAX] (so skip pushing to ebp) then call (push dword ptr [ebp+08h] becomes ??).\n\nPattern2: 74?? followed by ??.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at each instruction in the trace and see which ones can be skipped or altered.\n\nLooking back, after the initial mov edi, edi is pushed as esp, then ebp moved via 8BEC. Then push dword ptr [ebp+08h] (pushes to stack). Then call E7C3h (0040E7C3h) which is replaced with ??.\n\nSo each pattern could skip one of these steps:\n\n1. Skip the initial mov and test by having a JZ or JE before pushing.\n2. Skip the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h] by wildcarding that instruction's address.\n3. Skip the call E7C3h by making its address ??.\n\nSo let me try building each pattern accordingly.\n\nPattern1: TEST EAX + JZ[EAX+4] (so skip pushing) and then maybe another instruction like push something else.\n\nWait, in Yara, each pattern is a sequence of hex bytes. So:\n\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??. This could be TEST EAX+JZ[EAX] (using the JZ after TEST) and then skip pushing to ebp by making 8B45 as ??.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe it should include the next instruction after TEST, which is JZ or JE, then something else like a mov with wildcards.\n\nPattern2: Maybe replace the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h] (8B4F) with ??, so 74?? followed by another instruction.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each pattern as covering different steps:\n\n1. Skip after TEST EAX + JZ/EAX.\n2. Skip the call address itself.\n3. Skip a different push instruction before the call.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern0: Test and jump, then skip pushing to ebp.\nPattern1: Replace the call address with ??.\nPattern2: Skip another push instruction like 8B4F.\n\nLet me try writing them out with wildcards for addresses.\n\nPattern0:\n85 C0 (TEST EAX)\n?? ?? (JZ or JE after TEST)\nThen maybe a mov or something, but perhaps it's better to include the next instruction as well. So:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n\nWait, this might be too long.\n\nPattern1: Maybe skip the call by making its address wildcard:\nE8 ??: Let's see, EAX+40E7C3h becomes ??.\nBut I need to include leading instructions. So:\n\n$pattern1 = { 74 ?? (some conditional jump) followed by pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] as ?? }\n\nWait, maybe it's better to structure each pattern with a few bytes that can be skipped.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that after the call is another push instruction.\n\nSo Pattern2: After the call, skip the second push by making 8B4F as ??.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to look for wildcards in the trace and construct patterns based on that.\n\nWait, in the first push dword ptr [ebp+08h], that instruction is at 0040E7F3 (FF7508). So that's 0x00 0xFF 0x75 0x08. The address is ebp+08h, which in Yara can be represented as ??.\n\nSo Pattern1 could be: 8B4F as ??: 8B?? or something like that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nPattern0: TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (skip push) and then another instruction with a wildcard.\nPattern1: Replace the call address (0040E7C3h) with ??.\nPattern2: Skip the second push dword ptr [ebp+08h] by making that address ??.\n\nI think I can structure them as follows, ensuring each is 6-20 bytes and has wildcards where needed.\n\nFinal Patterns:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??: This might be too long. Maybe better to break it into smaller chunks.\nWait, perhaps $pattern0 is TEST EAX + JZ/EAX (so skip pushing) and then a mov something else.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n$pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the first pattern can be TEST EAX followed by JZ, skipping the next push, then moving an instruction that's after the call with ??: \n\nSo: 85 C0 (TEST) + 0F 84 (JZ[EAX+4]) ?? ?? ... etc.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Let me try to make them as per the examples in the template.\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected Yara rule with three bypass patterns, each covering different steps before or after the call instruction:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion {\n    meta:\n        description: \"Bypasses multiple evasion points\"\n        cape_options: \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **$pattern0:** Skips pushing to `ebp` by using wildcards for the address, effectively bypassing that step.\n\n2. **$pattern1:** Replaces a conditional instruction (74 ??) with another wildcarded address, bypassing subsequent instructions until the call is reached.\n\n3. **$pattern2:** Skipswrites and pushes to `ebp+08h` by making its address wildcarded, bypassing that step before the final call.",

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from the previous attempts. Let's see what we have here.\n\nFirst, looking at the iteration history, it seems that in the first attempt, a rule hit occurred but no new signatures were found. That probably means the existing pattern matched something too broad or not specific enough, causing false positives and preventing any meaningful changes.\n\nThe current best rule is \"None,\" which isn't helpful. So I need to think of alternative patterns based on the provided traces.\n\nLooking at the trace data for both TRACE #1 and TRACE #2, they share similar structures: a call to ExitProcess followed by a call to another function (0040E7C3h) with some offset manipulation. The key parts are around the call to ExitProcess where E8C8FFFFFF is used, which is a specific opcode for a conditional call.\n\nI remember from previous bypass attempts that using the exact instruction sequence helps because it's more likely to match only in the right location without too many false positives. So maybe focusing on this specific call pattern would be better.\n\nAlso, the strategy mentioned was Strategy A: Evasion Check at the first 30% of the trace with a pattern involving a test and JE/JNE. But since that didn't yield new signatures, perhaps I need to refine it.\n\nLet me break down the trace:\n- The call is made at 0040E7F6 with E8C8FFFFFF.\n- Then there's a pop on ebp (0040E7FB) followed by another call using FF7508 pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] (0040E7FC).\n\nSo maybe the bypass is happening before these calls, perhaps right after the call to 0040E7C3h. The idea would be to target this specific instruction sequence.\n\nI need patterns that are 6-20 bytes and use exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts like offsets or addresses.\n\nLooking at Strategy B: Exit decision before the exit call. Maybe I can find a pattern right after the call to ExitProcess but before manipulating ebp or other instructions.\n\nLet me see, in both traces, after E8C8FFFFFF (the call), there's 59 pop ecx followed by FF7508 pushing again. So maybe looking for something like [E8C8FFFFFF] followed by certain operations.\n\nWait, the original trace uses specific opcodes and memory accesses. Perhaps a pattern starting with E8C8FFFFFF would be too broad unless combined with other instructions that must follow.\n\nAlternatively, since the bypass is likely happening in the first part of the trace (_strategy A), maybe I can target the call to 0040E7C3h or something similar before manipulation.\n\nWait, but Strategy C suggests using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID. That might be more complex and not sure if applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a sequence that includes E8C8FFFFFF followed by certain instructions, ensuring it's in the right place.\n\nLet me think of possible patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern could be targeting the specific call to ExitProcess with E8C8FFFFFF immediately after a mov instruction or something similar.\n2. Another pattern might involve the manipulation of ebp right after the exit call, maybe checking for pop ecx followed by memory push.\n3. A third pattern could target any conditional checks before the exit decision.\n\nWait, but I need three distinct patterns. Let me try to extract specific sequences from the trace:\n\nLooking at the first part:\n- 0040E7EE: 8BFF (mov edi, edi)\n- 0040E7F0: 55 (push ebp)\n- 0040E7F1: 8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n- Then E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) at 0040E7F6.\n\nSo maybe the first pattern is looking for a call instruction right after mov ebp. So something like:\n\nPattern1: [8BEC] (mov ebp, esp) followed by [E8C8FFFFFF] (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) at 0040E7F6.\n\nBut to make it more specific, maybe include the exact offset or other following instructions. But since the trace uses FF7508 for the push, perhaps that's part of it.\n\nAlternatively, another pattern could be looking for a call dword ptr [0041B0ACh] right after certain operations. Wait, in both traces, after the call to ExitProcess at 0040E7F6, there's FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]).\n\nSo perhaps Pattern2 could be looking for a call to that specific address right after E8C8FFFFFF. But I'm not sure if the offset is fixed or variable.\n\nAnother approach: Since both traces have similar structures, maybe focusing on the exact sequence of instructions from 0040E7F6 onwards.\n\nLet me try to create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. Pattern A: The call to ExitProcess with E8C8FFFFFF at 0040E7F6.\n2. Pattern B: The manipulation of ebp right after that call, pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF7508).\n3. Pattern C: Any conditional checks before the call to ExitProcess.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure these patterns are specific enough and come from the trace data.\n\nLooking back, in both traces:\n\n- After 0040E7F6, it's E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]).\n- Then at 0040E7FB: 59 pop ecx.\n- At 0040E7FC: FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h].\n- At 0040E7FF: call dword ptr [0041B0ACh].\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern A could be targeting the E8C8FFFFFF call at offset 0x0040e7f6.\nPattern B could be looking for FF7508 after that, but only if it's immediately following.\nPattern C could be checking for any conditional checks before these calls.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of exact sequences:\n\nFor Pattern A: [E8C8FFFFFF] at 0x0040e7f6 followed by FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [0041b0ach]).\n\nPattern B: The sequence after the call, maybe starting with 59 pop ecx and then FF7508.\n\nPattern C: Maybe a conditional jump before these calls, but I'm not sure if it's present.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any conditional check (like JE/JMP) followed by the call to ExitProcess.\n\nWait, but in Strategy A, the pattern is TEST EAX with JE/JNE. So perhaps another way is to look for something that triggers a jump before the exit process.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. I think focusing on specific instruction sequences from the trace would be more effective. Each pattern should target a different part of the code to reduce false positives.\n\nSo, finalizing:\n\nPattern 1: E8C8FFFFFF at 0x0040e7f6 followed by FF15ACB04100.\nPattern 2: After that call, look for FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]).\nPattern 3: Any conditional checks before these calls, like a JE/JMP.\n\nI think this approach should target the specific bypass points more precisely, reducing overlaps and increasing the success rate of detection.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**\n\nThe original attempts focused on general patterns without precise targeting. By analyzing the trace data, we identified specific instruction sequences used in the ExitProcess call. We refined our strategy to focus on three distinct 6-byte patterns:\n\n1. The specific call to ExitProcess using E8C8FFFFFF at offset 0x0040e7f6.\n2. Following this call with a push operation using FF7508.\n3. Targeting any conditional checks before these calls.\n\nThese patterns are more specific, reducing false positives and increasing the likelihood of successful bypass detection.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specifically targeting known instruction sequences from exit process call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [0x40e7f6: E8C8FFFFFF] followed by [0x41b0ach: FF15ACB04100] }\n        $pattern1 = { [0x40e7f6: E8C8FFFFFF], [0x40e7fb: 59], [0x40e7fc: FF7508] }\n        $pattern2 = { any conditional check (JE/JMP) before the call to ExitProcess }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help improve a YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the evolution history, we've tried two iterations where the rule hit but didn't find new signatures. The latest attempt shows the same status with no new signatures. So, I need to figure out why and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe original trace provides some valuable information. There are two traces where ExitProcess is called, leading to different call sequences. Both involve a call to 0040E7C3h followed by a dword ptr call at 0041B0ACh. The bypass needs to target these calls effectively.\n\nI remember that YARA rules can be specific or generic. Specific patterns are better because they reduce false positives, but sometimes being too generic is necessary if you're trying different approaches without knowing the exact signature yet.\n\nLooking at Strategy A: EVASION CHECK. It looks for a JE/JNE instruction in the first 30% of the trace. Maybe I can find where the check happens before the call to ExitProcess. From the trace, after the push ebp and mov, there's an E8C8FFFFFF call which is likely the test, followed by a pop and then another call.\n\nStrategy B: EXIT DECISION involves checking if there are conditional checks before the exit. Since the exit itself has conditions, perhaps I can find where the decision to exit is made without the condition being triggered.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nIn both traces, after the E8C8FFFFFF call (probably a test), there's an FFFE0E2h instruction which sets some flags before the next call. This seems like it could be part of the bypass.\n\nI also notice that in the first trace, there's a 59 pop ecx after E8C8FFFFFF, then a push dword ptr [ebp+08h], followed by FF15ACB04100 which is the call to 0041B0ACh. So perhaps the decision point is before this.\n\nAnother thought: The RDTSC instruction might be used in bypass techniques for timing attacks, but since I don't have that in the trace data provided, maybe it's not necessary here.\n\nWait, let me focus on the calls. The test seems to involve a call to 0040E7C3h and then another dword ptr at 0041B0ACh. If these are conditional jumps or function calls with conditions, perhaps the bypass needs to target those.\n\nLooking back, after E8C8FFFFFF in both traces, there's an FFFE0E2 instruction which sets flags for the next call. So maybe this is where the condition is set before calling ExitProcess.\n\nSo, combining these thoughts, I can craft three patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern could be targeting the test function before the call to 0040E7C3h, looking for a JE/JNE instruction after certain bytes.\n2. The second pattern might focus on the conditional check right before the exit, maybe around FFFE0E2 followed by specific instructions.\n3. The third pattern could look at the dword ptr call and ensure it's unconditional.\n\nEach of these needs to be 6-20 bytes from the trace, using exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts like offsets.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is distinct and covers different points in the code flow to avoid relying on a single point which might have changed or added new conditions. This way, if one part becomes tricky, others can still work.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Data:** The trace shows two executions of ExitProcess with similar call sequences leading into 0040E7C3h and then a dword ptr call at 0041B0ACh.\n\n2. **Identifying Bypass Opportunities:** \n   - **Strategy A** suggests bypassing the test function (JE/JNE) before the call to ExitProcess.\n   - **Strategy B** targets any conditional checks before exiting.\n   \n3. **Analyzing Call Instructions:**\n   - After E8C8FFFFFF, there's an FFFE0E2 instruction which likely sets flags for subsequent calls.\n\n4. **Crafting Patterns:**\n   - Pattern 1 focuses on the test function (JE/JNE) after specific instructions.\n   - Pattern 2 targets the conditional check before ExitProcess.\n   - Pattern 3 ensures the dword ptr call is unconditional.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The analysis targeted different bypass opportunities by focusing on JE/JNE checks, conditional exits, and ensuring unconditional dword ptr calls. Each pattern was crafted to be specific yet flexible enough to handle variations in the code flow.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** CALL_TEST_JE, EXIT_DECISION, UNCONDITIONAL_CALL\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 75\n\n**REASONING:** The patterns were designed to bypass common exit paths by focusing on key conditional points and ensuring calls are made without conditions. This approach balances specificity with flexibility for future potential changes.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved using various bypass strategies\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 59 8B 4D F8 }  -- JE/JNE check after test call\n        $pattern1 = { FFFE 0E 22 FF 75 08 41 00 }  -- Conditional exit decision before ExitProcess\n        $pattern2 = { E8C8 FFFF FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }  -- Unconditional dword ptr call\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
