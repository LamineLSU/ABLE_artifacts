      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from the previous attempts. Let's see what we have here.\n\nFirst, looking at the iteration history, it seems that in the first attempt, a rule hit occurred but no new signatures were found. That probably means the existing pattern matched something too broad or not specific enough, causing false positives and preventing any meaningful changes.\n\nThe current best rule is \"None,\" which isn't helpful. So I need to think of alternative patterns based on the provided traces.\n\nLooking at the trace data for both TRACE #1 and TRACE #2, they share similar structures: a call to ExitProcess followed by a call to another function (0040E7C3h) with some offset manipulation. The key parts are around the call to ExitProcess where E8C8FFFFFF is used, which is a specific opcode for a conditional call.\n\nI remember from previous bypass attempts that using the exact instruction sequence helps because it's more likely to match only in the right location without too many false positives. So maybe focusing on this specific call pattern would be better.\n\nAlso, the strategy mentioned was Strategy A: Evasion Check at the first 30% of the trace with a pattern involving a test and JE/JNE. But since that didn't yield new signatures, perhaps I need to refine it.\n\nLet me break down the trace:\n- The call is made at 0040E7F6 with E8C8FFFFFF.\n- Then there's a pop on ebp (0040E7FB) followed by another call using FF7508 pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] (0040E7FC).\n\nSo maybe the bypass is happening before these calls, perhaps right after the call to 0040E7C3h. The idea would be to target this specific instruction sequence.\n\nI need patterns that are 6-20 bytes and use exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts like offsets or addresses.\n\nLooking at Strategy B: Exit decision before the exit call. Maybe I can find a pattern right after the call to ExitProcess but before manipulating ebp or other instructions.\n\nLet me see, in both traces, after E8C8FFFFFF (the call), there's 59 pop ecx followed by FF7508 pushing again. So maybe looking for something like [E8C8FFFFFF] followed by certain operations.\n\nWait, the original trace uses specific opcodes and memory accesses. Perhaps a pattern starting with E8C8FFFFFF would be too broad unless combined with other instructions that must follow.\n\nAlternatively, since the bypass is likely happening in the first part of the trace (_strategy A), maybe I can target the call to 0040E7C3h or something similar before manipulation.\n\nWait, but Strategy C suggests using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID. That might be more complex and not sure if applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a sequence that includes E8C8FFFFFF followed by certain instructions, ensuring it's in the right place.\n\nLet me think of possible patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern could be targeting the specific call to ExitProcess with E8C8FFFFFF immediately after a mov instruction or something similar.\n2. Another pattern might involve the manipulation of ebp right after the exit call, maybe checking for pop ecx followed by memory push.\n3. A third pattern could target any conditional checks before the exit decision.\n\nWait, but I need three distinct patterns. Let me try to extract specific sequences from the trace:\n\nLooking at the first part:\n- 0040E7EE: 8BFF (mov edi, edi)\n- 0040E7F0: 55 (push ebp)\n- 0040E7F1: 8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n- Then E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) at 0040E7F6.\n\nSo maybe the first pattern is looking for a call instruction right after mov ebp. So something like:\n\nPattern1: [8BEC] (mov ebp, esp) followed by [E8C8FFFFFF] (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) at 0040E7F6.\n\nBut to make it more specific, maybe include the exact offset or other following instructions. But since the trace uses FF7508 for the push, perhaps that's part of it.\n\nAlternatively, another pattern could be looking for a call dword ptr [0041B0ACh] right after certain operations. Wait, in both traces, after the call to ExitProcess at 0040E7F6, there's FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]).\n\nSo perhaps Pattern2 could be looking for a call to that specific address right after E8C8FFFFFF. But I'm not sure if the offset is fixed or variable.\n\nAnother approach: Since both traces have similar structures, maybe focusing on the exact sequence of instructions from 0040E7F6 onwards.\n\nLet me try to create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. Pattern A: The call to ExitProcess with E8C8FFFFFF at 0040E7F6.\n2. Pattern B: The manipulation of ebp right after that call, pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF7508).\n3. Pattern C: Any conditional checks before the call to ExitProcess.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure these patterns are specific enough and come from the trace data.\n\nLooking back, in both traces:\n\n- After 0040E7F6, it's E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]).\n- Then at 0040E7FB: 59 pop ecx.\n- At 0040E7FC: FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h].\n- At 0040E7FF: call dword ptr [0041B0ACh].\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern A could be targeting the E8C8FFFFFF call at offset 0x0040e7f6.\nPattern B could be looking for FF7508 after that, but only if it's immediately following.\nPattern C could be checking for any conditional checks before these calls.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of exact sequences:\n\nFor Pattern A: [E8C8FFFFFF] at 0x0040e7f6 followed by FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [0041b0ach]).\n\nPattern B: The sequence after the call, maybe starting with 59 pop ecx and then FF7508.\n\nPattern C: Maybe a conditional jump before these calls, but I'm not sure if it's present.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any conditional check (like JE/JMP) followed by the call to ExitProcess.\n\nWait, but in Strategy A, the pattern is TEST EAX with JE/JNE. So perhaps another way is to look for something that triggers a jump before the exit process.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. I think focusing on specific instruction sequences from the trace would be more effective. Each pattern should target a different part of the code to reduce false positives.\n\nSo, finalizing:\n\nPattern 1: E8C8FFFFFF at 0x0040e7f6 followed by FF15ACB04100.\nPattern 2: After that call, look for FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]).\nPattern 3: Any conditional checks before these calls, like a JE/JMP.\n\nI think this approach should target the specific bypass points more precisely, reducing overlaps and increasing the success rate of detection.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**\n\nThe original attempts focused on general patterns without precise targeting. By analyzing the trace data, we identified specific instruction sequences used in the ExitProcess call. We refined our strategy to focus on three distinct 6-byte patterns:\n\n1. The specific call to ExitProcess using E8C8FFFFFF at offset 0x0040e7f6.\n2. Following this call with a push operation using FF7508.\n3. Targeting any conditional checks before these calls.\n\nThese patterns are more specific, reducing false positives and increasing the likelihood of successful bypass detection.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specifically targeting known instruction sequences from exit process call\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [0x40e7f6: E8C8FFFFFF] followed by [0x41b0ach: FF15ACB04100] }\n        $pattern1 = { [0x40e7f6: E8C8FFFFFF], [0x40e7fb: 59], [0x40e7fc: FF7508] }\n        $pattern2 = { any conditional check (JE/JMP) before the call to ExitProcess }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help improve a YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. Let me go through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the evolution history, we've tried two iterations where the rule hit but didn't find new signatures. The latest attempt shows the same status with no new signatures. So, I need to figure out why and adjust accordingly.\n\nThe original trace provides some valuable information. There are two traces where ExitProcess is called, leading to different call sequences. Both involve a call to 0040E7C3h followed by a dword ptr call at 0041B0ACh. The bypass needs to target these calls effectively.\n\nI remember that YARA rules can be specific or generic. Specific patterns are better because they reduce false positives, but sometimes being too generic is necessary if you're trying different approaches without knowing the exact signature yet.\n\nLooking at Strategy A: EVASION CHECK. It looks for a JE/JNE instruction in the first 30% of the trace. Maybe I can find where the check happens before the call to ExitProcess. From the trace, after the push ebp and mov, there's an E8C8FFFFFF call which is likely the test, followed by a pop and then another call.\n\nStrategy B: EXIT DECISION involves checking if there are conditional checks before the exit. Since the exit itself has conditions, perhaps I can find where the decision to exit is made without the condition being triggered.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nIn both traces, after the E8C8FFFFFF call (probably a test), there's an FFFE0E2h instruction which sets some flags before the next call. This seems like it could be part of the bypass.\n\nI also notice that in the first trace, there's a 59 pop ecx after E8C8FFFFFF, then a push dword ptr [ebp+08h], followed by FF15ACB04100 which is the call to 0041B0ACh. So perhaps the decision point is before this.\n\nAnother thought: The RDTSC instruction might be used in bypass techniques for timing attacks, but since I don't have that in the trace data provided, maybe it's not necessary here.\n\nWait, let me focus on the calls. The test seems to involve a call to 0040E7C3h and then another dword ptr at 0041B0ACh. If these are conditional jumps or function calls with conditions, perhaps the bypass needs to target those.\n\nLooking back, after E8C8FFFFFF in both traces, there's an FFFE0E2 instruction which sets flags for the next call. So maybe this is where the condition is set before calling ExitProcess.\n\nSo, combining these thoughts, I can craft three patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern could be targeting the test function before the call to 0040E7C3h, looking for a JE/JNE instruction after certain bytes.\n2. The second pattern might focus on the conditional check right before the exit, maybe around FFFE0E2 followed by specific instructions.\n3. The third pattern could look at the dword ptr call and ensure it's unconditional.\n\nEach of these needs to be 6-20 bytes from the trace, using exact hex values where possible with wildcards for varying parts like offsets.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is distinct and covers different points in the code flow to avoid relying on a single point which might have changed or added new conditions. This way, if one part becomes tricky, others can still work.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Trace Data:** The trace shows two executions of ExitProcess with similar call sequences leading into 0040E7C3h and then a dword ptr call at 0041B0ACh.\n\n2. **Identifying Bypass Opportunities:** \n   - **Strategy A** suggests bypassing the test function (JE/JNE) before the call to ExitProcess.\n   - **Strategy B** targets any conditional checks before exiting.\n   \n3. **Analyzing Call Instructions:**\n   - After E8C8FFFFFF, there's an FFFE0E2 instruction which likely sets flags for subsequent calls.\n\n4. **Crafting Patterns:**\n   - Pattern 1 focuses on the test function (JE/JNE) after specific instructions.\n   - Pattern 2 targets the conditional check before ExitProcess.\n   - Pattern 3 ensures the dword ptr call is unconditional.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The analysis targeted different bypass opportunities by focusing on JE/JNE checks, conditional exits, and ensuring unconditional dword ptr calls. Each pattern was crafted to be specific yet flexible enough to handle variations in the code flow.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** CALL_TEST_JE, EXIT_DECISION, UNCONDITIONAL_CALL\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 75\n\n**REASONING:** The patterns were designed to bypass common exit paths by focusing on key conditional points and ensuring calls are made without conditions. This approach balances specificity with flexibility for future potential changes.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved using various bypass strategies\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 59 8B 4D F8 }  -- JE/JNE check after test call\n        $pattern1 = { FFFE 0E 22 FF 75 08 41 00 }  -- Conditional exit decision before ExitProcess\n        $pattern2 = { E8C8 FFFF FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }  -- Unconditional dword ptr call\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
