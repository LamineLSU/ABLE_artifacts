Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from the current attempt. The goal is to bypass the malware evasion by targeting specific parts of the trace provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, there are several calls and checks happening before the exit process. From the STRATEGY A, which was trying to find a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE, it didn't result in a hit because the rule was too broad or maybe the pattern wasn't specific enough.\n\nThe latest attempt had some issues with generating the YARA rule, so I need to think of more specific patterns that can be found within this trace. Each pattern must come from the original data and should be 6-20 bytes long.\n\nI noticed there's a call at 012CE243: FF15B0702D01 which is calling dword ptr [012D70B0h]. This might be a target for strategy C, using unique instructions. So maybe the first pattern could capture this specific call.\n\nLooking further back in the trace, there's an instruction at 012CE208: mov edi, edi which is followed by pushing ebp and moving it to esp with 8BEC. This seems like part of a function that might be checked before exiting. So perhaps pattern two could capture this sequence.\n\nAnother point is at 012CE23A where there's another call. Maybe the third pattern can target something else, but I need to ensure each pattern is different and specific.\n\nI have to make sure each pattern uses exact hex values from the trace and includes wildcards for varying parts like offsets or addresses. Also, ensuring that all three patterns are distinct to cover different possible exit paths without overlapping.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these into a YARA rule with each pattern having its own condition, referencing them in the strings section.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe current best rule didn't find any matches because it was too broad. The failure indicated that the patterns used were either not specific enough or didn't match at the correct locations. To improve, I identified three distinct bypass points from the trace: a specific call at 012CE243 (strategy C), an early conditional check around 012CE208-012CE217 (strategy A), and another unique instruction sequence that needs to be targeted specifically. These patterns are designed to be more precise, using exact values from the trace while allowing flexibility for variations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**  \n1. **CALL TEST JUMP**: Targets a specific call instruction.\n2. **FIRST 30% CHECK**: Focuses on an early conditional check.\n3. **UNIQUE INSTRUCTION SEQUENCE**: Captures another distinct behavior in the code flow.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:**  \n95  \n\n**REASONING:**  \nThese patterns are more specific than previous attempts, increasing their chances of matching the target without causing errors. By using exact values from the trace and varying offsets where needed, each pattern is tailored to different possible exit paths or decision points in the code.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with specific patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 012CE243: FF15B0702D01 }\n        $pattern1 = { 012CE208: 8BFF, 012CE20A: 55, 012CE20B: 8BEC }\n        $pattern2 = { 012CE23A: FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
