(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user correct their Yara rule based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original Yara rule they provided had several issues. First, it was missing the `cape_options` section in the meta tags, which is crucial for Yara's functionality. Second, each of their patterns was too short\u2014only 8 bytes\u2014and didn't meet the required length of 6-20 bytes per pattern.\n\nLooking at their trace data, I see three main points where the malware might be bypassing checks:\n1. The call to `E8F7250000` which is a function call modification.\n2. The use of `FF7508` as a memory operand modifier.\n3. Another call using `FF7508`.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns, each 6-20 bytes long, by combining relevant instructions from the trace. I'll include context before and after the target instruction to make the patterns specific.\n\nFor the first pattern, focusing on the `E8F7250000` call:\n- The opcode is `E8`, followed by four address bytes (?? ?? ?? ??).\n- Then comes the operand pushing (`8B 45`), which I'll keep concrete.\n- Followed by other instructions that can be replaced with wildcards or kept as needed.\n\nThe second pattern for the first `FF7508`:\n- Starts with `6A`, then a few operations leading up to the instruction, including some wildcards where offsets are involved.\n\nFor the third pattern around the second `E8F7250000` call, I'll mirror the structure of the first one but ensure it's different enough from the others by varying the surrounding instructions or the number of bytes used.\n\nI also need to make sure that each pattern uses wildcards for any address/offset bytes and keeps other opcodes and register encodings concrete. This helps in making the patterns specific without introducing too many wildcards, which could reduce their effectiveness.\n\nFinally, I'll format each pattern correctly with spaces between hex bytes and ensure they're enclosed in `{ }\". I'll also include all three patterns in the strings section under `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, and `$pattern2`.\n\nI should double-check that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long. Let me count:\n- Pattern 1: 8 bytes\n- Pattern 2: 8 bytes\n- Pattern 3: 8 bytes\n\nWait, each of these is only 8 bytes. I need to make sure they're within the required length. If necessary, I can add more instructions or adjust where I apply wildcards to reach at least 6 bytes.\n\nLooking back at the example provided by the user, some patterns were longer than others but still met the criteria. So adding a bit more context might help without making them too long.\n\nLet me finalize each pattern with appropriate wildcards and ensure they're unique.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45C30107010102 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8F725C00F84 ?? 8B45C301070102 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A5A8BCEE8F725C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
