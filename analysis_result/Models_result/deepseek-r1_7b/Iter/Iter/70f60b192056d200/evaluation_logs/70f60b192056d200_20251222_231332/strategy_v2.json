        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct this Yara rule based on the user's request and the provided information. Let me start by understanding what was wrong with the previous attempt.\n\nThe original Yara rule had some issues: missing strings, no proper pattern structures, incorrect wildcard usage, and improper formatting. The user mentioned that each string must be exactly 3 different patterns, all in hex form with wildcards where applicable.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the valid instructions from the trace data to extract possible patterns. From the traces, I can see a lot of mov, call, je, cmp, jne, etc., but since this is an evasion bypass, maybe focusing on call jumps would make sense because they're often used for code execution bypass.\n\nThe user provided some examples of how patterns should be structured. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long and include wildcards where applicable. Also, each string (pattern) needs to be a different hex sequence but from the same trace data.\n\nLooking at the previous attempt, the strings were using 4-byte calls with fixed offsets, which might not cover all cases. I should replace those offsets with wildcards to make them more adaptable.\n\nI'll start by identifying three distinct call instruction patterns:\n\n1. The first call is E8 F7250000 at address 0041DED2h. To include context, maybe add the next few bytes: the cmp eax and je instructions after it.\n   So the pattern would be E8 followed by ?? for the offset (since F7 was a specific value before but now wildcard), then the next four bytes as ??.\n\nWait, no, in the example given earlier, the user suggested that for CALLs, the offset is 4 bytes. So maybe the first call can be represented as E8 with four wildcards after it.\n\n2. The second call seems to have a different offset and another instruction before it. Maybe it's C1 E808 followed by some other instructions like shr, test, jne.\n   I'll need to capture that sequence but make sure the offsets are wildcarded if they're fixed in the original data.\n\n3. Another possible pattern is from the 6A instruction with wildcards around it and including a push or pop operation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can structure each string as follows:\n\n- String1: E8 (CALL) followed by four wildcards for the offset.\n- String2: C1 E808 ?? ??? etc., but need to make sure it's 6 bytes with wildcards where needed.\n- String3: 6A ???? 5A etc.\n\nI think I should look at each instruction in the trace and see which can form a unique pattern when including surrounding instructions. Also, ensuring that each string is different from the others by varying the operands or context.\n\nOnce I have three unique patterns with proper wildcards, I'll format them correctly, making sure each has 6-20 bytes and all address/offsets are replaced with ??.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { C1 E8 08 ?? ?? ???? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
