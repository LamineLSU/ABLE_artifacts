(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to fix this Yara rule that was supposed to detect a malware evasion bypass but failed validation. The main issues were missing basic structure and incorrect patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at the error message, it says there are missing basic YARA rules\u2014specifically, they're missing the name, strings, condition, etc. So I need to make sure all those parts are included correctly.\n\nThe original rule had a meta section with a description and cape_options but didn't have the proper strings or conditions. It also only defined one pattern instead of three required ones. Plus, the patterns might not be specific enough or correctly structured.\n\nFrom the task analysis, I know that the malware uses ExitProcess with some pushes before it. The valid trace data shows two instances where after a call (E8C8FFFFFF), there are push operations to dword ptr [ebp+08h]. \n\nSo for the bypass points, each target is likely one of these push instructions followed by another instruction. Maybe each pattern corresponds to a different part of this sequence.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns, each 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary and keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nLooking at the example given in the task, I can see that combining two or more instructions into one pattern is possible. For instance, including the target instruction plus surrounding context.\n\nI should extract exact sequences from the trace data for each bypass point. Maybe:\n\n1. The first push after E8C8FFFFFF.\n2. The second push right before ExitProcess.\n3. The last push in a different context.\n\nEach of these will form one pattern. I'll replace all address or offset bytes with ?? and keep opcodes and registers as they are.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern is unique, so the byte sequences shouldn't repeat from each other. Let's make sure each includes different surrounding instructions or wildcards in specific places.\n\nFinally, I'll format these patterns correctly, wrapping them in { }, separating bytes with spaces, etc. Then, include all three in the strings section of the meta.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description: \"Evasion bypass rule - uses common structures to bypass two exits\"\n        cape_options: \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BEC 89EAX FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFFFF FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 FF7508 FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
