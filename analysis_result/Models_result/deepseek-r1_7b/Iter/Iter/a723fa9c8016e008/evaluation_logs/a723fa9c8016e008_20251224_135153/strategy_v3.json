(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a Yara rule based on the given trace data that's supposed to detect an evasion bypass in a sandbox environment. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.\n\nFirst, they provided some Yara trace from different processes: Process 1 (P1), Process 2 (P2), and the main process (Process). Each has a series of instructions with hex values. The goal is to analyze this trace as an attacker's evasion strategy and then reverse-engineer it to create a bypass rule for defenders.\n\nSo, Phase 1 is from the attacker's perspective: they implemented some checks in their code to detect certain behaviors. I need to see where those checks are in the trace and what instructions correspond to them. Then, identify how the attacker bypasses these checks.\n\nLooking at the trace, there are multiple calls to functions like P2, which might be part of a sandbox detection mechanism. The attacker could have inserted code that evades these checks by manipulating certain instructions.\n\nIn Phase 2, from the defender's perspective, I need to find where in the execution flow an attacker can manipulate the instruction sequence to bypass their own checks. This involves identifying decision points or operations where skipping an instruction would cause the check to fail, allowing the process to continue executing normally without triggering the sandbox's protection.\n\nFor each potential bypass point, I'll think about which instructions could be skipped and what effect that has on the overall control flow or register state, thus evading the checks. For example, if a conditional jump is present, skipping it might alter the instruction sequence in a way that avoids the attacker's detection mechanisms.\n\nIn Phase 3, once I've identified three solid bypass points from the trace data, each surrounded by relevant context instructions, I can create patterns for them. Each pattern should be exactly six to twenty bytes long, combining the target instruction with surrounding context and using wildcards (??) where appropriate for address/offset bytes.\n\nI also need to ensure that each of these three patterns is distinct in their hex sequences so they don't overlap or cause confusion. Additionally, I'll have to format them correctly within Yara's syntax, making sure to include the necessary wildcards and keep opcode and register-encoding bytes concrete.\n\nFor each pattern, I might start by identifying a specific instruction that represents an evasion check, then look at nearby instructions in the trace to see how they can be manipulated. For example, if there's a call instruction followed by certain checks on registers, skipping the call or altering its offset could bypass those checks.\n\nLet me try mapping out potential bypass points from the provided trace:\n\nLooking at Process 1:\n- There are multiple calls (E8 ...) and P2 function calls.\n- Each has different offsets. Maybe an attacker inserted a call to bypass a specific check in P2's code.\n\nIn Process 2, similar patterns with E8 jumps of varying offsets suggest some kind of sandbox mechanism checking memory access permissions.\n\nThe main Process seems to be executing legitimate Windows commands, but the attacker might have inserted their own code at certain points that are not supposed to interfere.\n\nPotential bypass points could involve:\n1. Skipping a call to P2 by using an offset instruction (like E8 followed by four wildcards) which would replace the actual offset.\n2. Bypassing a conditional jump near a function call, perhaps by replacing specific bytes with wildcards so that the condition isn't checked.\n3. Hiding an executable in memory by overwriting certain addresses with wildcards.\n\nEach of these points needs to be translated into a Yara pattern using the correct syntax and wildcards where applicable.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern is unique but still matches exactly six to twenty bytes, combining the target instruction with surrounding context. For example:\n\nPattern 1 could involve skipping an E8 call by replacing its offset.\nPattern 2 might be a conditional jump (like 75 followed by an address) that can be bypassed by modifying the address.\nPattern 3 could hide data in memory, represented by wildcarding displacement bytes.\n\nFinally, I'll structure each pattern with surrounding context to make them specific enough and ensure they fit into Yara's required format. Each pattern will have a mix of concrete opcode bytes and wildcards for any address or offset bytes involved.\n\nOnce all three patterns are created, I'll compile them into the Yara rule, making sure to include the correct meta description and cape_options with action0, action1, etc., set to \"skip\" since it's bypassing checks.\n</think>\n\nTo create a Yara rule based on the provided trace data for detecting an evasion bypass, we analyze potential attack vectors and craft specific patterns.\n\n### Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective\nThe attacker likely implemented checks using conditional jumps (e.g., 75 near) to detect memory accesses. The attacker bypassed these by inserting a code at an offset instruction, replacing the exact address with wildcards.\n\n### Phase 2: Defender's Analysis\nKey decision points include:\n1. Conditional jumps that can be bypassed without executing.\n2. Memory addresses where data corruption could hide evasive code.\n3. Register manipulations to avoid checks on specific values.\n\n### Phase 3: Bypass Points\n1. **Conditional Jump Bypass**: The attacker skipped a conditional jump (75 near) by wildcasing the displacement.\n2. **Memory Overwrite**: Inserted evasive code at an address, using wildcarding for displacement.\n3. **Instruction Shifting**: Altered an instruction's offset to bypass a call check.\n\n### Patterns\nEach pattern combines target instructions with context and uses wildcards where appropriate.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 75 C3 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
