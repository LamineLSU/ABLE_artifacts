Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. Let's break down what I have here.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace data, it shows two calls to ExitProcess, specifically at 0040E7F6 in both cases. The patterns around these points involve some mov and push instructions leading up to a call. In each case, there's a call to 0040E7C3h with E8C8FFFFFF as the argument, followed by another push and then a call to 0041B0ACh.\n\nFrom the previous attempts, it seems like the rule didn't hit because of an error in generating YARA. The key is to find patterns that bypass ExitProcess effectively without causing errors.\n\nLooking at Strategy A: Evasion Check. It suggests checking the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. But since the exit process is called, maybe this isn't where the bypass should happen.\n\nStrategy B: Exit Decision involves checking before the exit call, perhaps looking at conditional checks. The patterns in the trace have push operations and calls that might be used to bypass.\n\nStrategy C uses techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID, but since we need specific patterns from the trace, maybe focusing on the actual instruction sequences is better.\n\nSince both ExitProcess calls are similar, I think using these identical sequences could help bypass. Each call has E8C8FFFFFF as an argument, which seems to be a fixed offset. Maybe matching this exact sequence would work.\n\nAnother thought: The push dword ptr [ebp+08h] before the call might be used for bypassing. If we can match these specific instructions, it could help in bypassing the check.\n\nAlso, considering the previous failed attempts, maybe using wildcards where there are varying offsets or addresses. But since E8C8FFFFFF is fixed, perhaps matching that exactly would avoid issues.\n\nI should create three different 6-20 byte patterns from the trace data. Each pattern must include specific instructions found in the trace without introducing new bytes to prevent mismatches.\n\nPattern 1: The initial part of ExitProcess with mov edi, edi and push ebp.\nPattern 2: The conditional check before the call, maybe something like JE/JNE with TEST EAX.\nPattern 3: The specific argument used in the call, like E8C8FFFFFF.\n\nWait, but Strategy A mentions location as first 30%, which might not be where the bypass is happening. So perhaps focusing on the exit decision area (Strategy B) would be better.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace to increase success chances without overlapping issues.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe previous attempts revealed that the ExitProcess calls are being made at specific locations in the trace. By focusing on these identical sequences, we can create patterns that bypass the exit process more effectively. Each pattern targets a unique part of the call stack and argument sequence to ensure specificity without causing errors.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**  \n- Pattern 1: Conditional check (JE/JNE) before the call.\n- Pattern 2: Specific argument used in the call (E8C8FFFFFF).\n- Pattern 3: Preceding instructions that may be involved in bypassing checks.\n\nThese patterns are designed to match specific segments of the trace, increasing the likelihood of a successful bypass while maintaining specificity.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**  \n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

From the first trace: E8 C8 FFFFFFFF (call), then 59 (pop ecx), FF7508 (push dword ptr).\n2. Another sequence starting with push ebp, then 8BEC (mov ebp, esp), followed by FF7508.\n3. A third unique pattern combining different instructions.\n\nEach pattern must be between 6-20 bytes and use wildcards for address/offsets. I'll ensure each is distinct to cover different bypass paths.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeting exit decision points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B C8 FFFFFF ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 59 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { E8 EC 8B 45 ???? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
