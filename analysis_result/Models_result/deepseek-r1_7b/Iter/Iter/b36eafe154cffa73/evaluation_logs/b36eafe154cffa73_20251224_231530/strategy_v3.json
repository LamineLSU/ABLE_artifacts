(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help analyze this malware trace where it's evading detection by bypassing some checks. The user provided three traces with different exit points and the goal is to find a way to create bypass patterns that can trick the analysis tool into thinking the malware continues executing normally.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each trace. Let me look at them one by one.\n\nStarting with Trace #1: It exits at 00401082. The instructions here involve pushing some values onto the stack and then calling a function. There's an 'add' instruction before the call which seems suspicious. Maybe this is where the bypass happens? So, if that add instruction is skipped or modified, it might bypass the check.\n\nTrace #2 exits at 004084CF. This one has a lot more instructions, including some calls and memory operations. I notice multiple push operations before pushing 0x00000000h twice. Then there are several call instructions like FF155C7D4200 and FF15887C4200. There's also a lot of mov and add operations, especially towards the end with 90s and 7F checks. So maybe if one of these calls is bypassed or altered, it could cause an evasion.\n\nTrace #3 exits at 004082D2. Here, there are several push operations followed by calls to dword ptr [00427C64h] and another call to 00427C88h via the same function. Again, looking for where checks might be happening.\n\nNow, from an attacker's perspective (malware author), they probably implemented some basic checks in these traces before calling into the victim code. The first check is likely the add instruction at 00401053 in Trace #1, which adds a known value to EBP. If this addition isn't performed or changes, it might bypass the initial check.\n\nIn Trace #2, the multiple push operations and calls could be checks to ensure the stack is manipulated correctly before proceeding. Perhaps moving certain values with push and then checking if they're in memory with calls like FF15887C4200 could be where the bypass happens.\n\nFor Trace #3, the series of pushes followed by two similar call instructions might be a check for specific data being pushed onto the stack or into memory. If one of these calls is skipped or altered, it might allow bypass.\n\nAs a defender, I need to find ways to manipulate these points without triggering the checks. For each target:\n\n1. In Trace #1, if the add instruction (00401053) can be skipped or has its operands changed, that would bypass the initial check.\n2. In Trace #2, perhaps one of the calls like FF15887C4200 is a checkpoint; skipping it might allow execution to continue without triggering the check.\n3. In Trace #3, if either of the two similar call instructions can be bypassed or altered, execution would proceed.\n\nI need to create patterns that target these specific points. Each pattern should include enough context before and after the target instruction so that it's unique but still matches only at those locations. Using wildcards for address/offset bytes as per the rules is crucial to keep the patterns general enough not to match other legitimate code.\n\nLet me try constructing each pattern:\n\nFor Trace #1, focusing on the add instruction (00401053). The surrounding instructions involve pushing ebp and other registers. If I can skip or alter the addition here, it might bypass the check. So a pattern could include the push ebp, the add instruction with some wildcards, then the mov into the return address.\n\nFor Trace #2, looking at one of the later calls, say FF15887C4200. If this call is skipped or modified, it might bypass the check that ensures data is correct in memory before proceeding. The context would include all the push operations and other surrounding instructions leading up to this call.\n\nFor Trace #3, maybe one of the two similar calls can be bypassed. So a pattern could target either FF15887C4200 or another instruction that's called twice with slightly different parameters but is effectively the same check.\n\nEach pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions with wildcards where appropriate. I'll make sure each includes unique context before and after the target instruction to ensure specificity.\n</think>\n\nTo create bypass patterns for each trace, we analyze the key points of evasion and craft specific instructions that can alter these without triggering detection.\n\n**Trace #1 Bypass:**\nThe first check is an addition at 00401053. By modifying or skipping this add instruction, it evades the initial check.\n- **Pattern:** `8B45FC E8 50 8B4C F27D 51 8D95F9 FEFFFF C1 6A00 push 00000000h PSH_00000000h PSH_EBP_00000000h PSH_00000040h TEST EAX,00000000h JNZ 00401088h`\n\n**Trace #2 Bypass:**\nThe second check involves a call to dword ptr [00427C88h] at 004084CF. By bypassing this call, execution continues without the check.\n- **Pattern:** `FF15887C4200 call dword ptr [00427C88h] PSH_00000000h TEST EAX,00000000h JC 004084D8h`\n\n**Trace #3 Bypass:**\nThe third check involves a call to dword ptr [00427C64h] at 004082D2. By bypassing this call, the evasion succeeds.\n- **Pattern:** `FF15887C4200 call dword ptr [00427C64h] PSH_00000000h TEST EAX,00000000h JC 004082D8h`\n\nEach pattern is crafted to target specific instructions while including surrounding context to ensure specificity.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for sandbox analysis\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC E8 50 8B4C F27D 51 8D95F9 FEFFFF C1 ?? ?? ?? ??

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help correct this Yara rule that was previously invalid. The user provided a lot of information, including some previous attempts and the error messages. \n\nFirst, looking at the initial task, it's about creating a bypass rule using specific patterns. But in the meta section, the 'cape_options' is missing. I remember from the validation errors that this field is crucial because it tells Yara where to look for breakpoints.\n\nThe user tried adding 'cape_options', but maybe they didn't format it correctly or include enough concrete instructions. The correct format requires each pattern to be a separate string in $pattern0, $pattern1, etc., and then the cape_options should reference these with their indices.\n\nLooking at the previous attempts, I see that some patterns were too short or had hardcoded addresses. So, for each pattern, I need to include enough context bytes after the target instruction to make them specific but not unique to a single execution trace. That way, they can match multiple places where bypass is attempted.\n\nAlso, the wildcards (??) should replace any address or offset bytes. For example, if an instruction has an offset that could be anything, it's replaced with ??.\n\nI'll start by identifying three different points in the provided traces where a bypass attempt might occur. Each point will form its own pattern with surrounding instructions and appropriate wildcards. \n\nFor each of these patterns, I'll ensure they are 6-20 bytes long. Maybe combining two or three consecutive instructions to get enough context without being too specific.\n\nI also need to make sure that the 'cape_options' field is correctly formatted, referencing each $pattern with their index (0, 1, 2) and including the count as well.\n\nAfter generating these patterns, I'll structure them into the Yara rule format provided in the template, making sure there are exactly three patterns and they're properly enclosed within braces.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description: \"Evasion bypass rule targeting three decision points\"\n        cape_options: \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            8B45FCE5 + 0x3\n            E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n            83C420 ?? ?? ?? ??\n            FF15647D + 0x4\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            0049E87A + 0x0\n            00C8F5FF + 0x0\n            E83D2070 + 0x0\n            FF15647D + 0x0\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            0049E87A + 0x0\n            00C8F5FF + 0x0\n            E83D2070 + 0x0\n            FF15647D + 0x0\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the Yara rule for the evasion bypass based on the provided trace data and the previous errors identified. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: each pattern is too short (1 byte) and there are duplicates. The patterns must be 6-20 bytes long and unique. So, I need to create three distinct patterns from the given traces.\n\nThe task mentions that each bypass point should target different evasion points, so I'll look for three different places in the trace where the attacker is checking for something and find how they can be bypassed.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1: There's a call to dword ptr [00427DB4h]. The patterns before this are mov ebp, esp, then push ebp. So maybe I can skip the push ebp instruction here.\n\nIn TRACE #2: There are several calls and some jumps with conditions. Maybe around the E8F5C0FFFF instruction in the middle of the trace where it's checking for something specific. Perhaps skipping a different instruction there would bypass this check.\n\nTRACE #3 has multiple calls and leasds, but perhaps the call at 004082D2 can be bypassed by skipping an earlier instruction like push eax or another nearby op.\n\nNow, I need to create three patterns based on these traces. Each pattern will combine several instructions into a hex sequence with wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nFor $pattern0: Maybe after the first E8 instruction in TRACE #2, there's a call that can be bypassed by skipping the push ebp before it.\n\nSo, something like `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`. Wait, let me check. The E8 instruction has an offset after, and then we have conditional jumps with another op. So the pattern would include E8 followed by four wildcards for the offset, then 83C4 (which is a conditional jump), etc.\n\nFor $pattern1: In TRACE #2, there's a call to [00427C88h]. Maybe after that, we can find another instruction. Alternatively, in TRACE #3, maybe after E8D5F8, which is lea edx,... So the pattern could be `6A ?? 51 ?? ?? ?? ?? F8 ?? ?? ??`.\n\nFor $pattern2: In TRACE #1, before the call to [00427DB4h], there's a push ebp. Skipping that would bypass this check. So maybe combining the EBP push with some surrounding instructions.\n\nWait, in the initial rule, the first pattern was 6A40, which was too short. I need to expand each into at least 6 bytes by adding context or more instructions.\n\nI think I have a better plan now. Each pattern will be constructed from two consecutive instructions, including wildcards for any address/offsets and concrete opcode and register bytes.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
