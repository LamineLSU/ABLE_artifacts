      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given malware trace data to identify possible bypass sequences that could have been used to evade detection. The goal is to create a Yara rule based on these traces.\n\nFirst, looking at TRACE #1, there's an exit process call at 013161F8 with a call to 0131A12Ch. I notice several instructions before that which could be part of the bypass. There are test and jump instructions that might have been used to control flow.\n\nIn TRACE #2, the exit is called from 0040E7F6, which calls 0040E7C3h. The call instruction here has an offset of 0x08 in the stack (FF7508). This might indicate a bypass through a function that's pushing a value to the stack.\n\nTRACE #3 is similar to TRACE #2 but with a different exit point at 0040E7FF. It also calls the same function, suggesting a common path used for evasion in both cases.\n\nI think the main idea here is that the malware tried to call an external function multiple times with slightly different parameters or paths. The bypass likely involves manipulating the stack or using conditional jumps to avoid detection.\n\nLooking closer at the instructions:\n\nIn TRACE #1, after the push and mov, there's a call instruction with an offset of 0x08 (FF7508). This could be part of a bypass sequence where the function is called with that specific offset. The offset might have been used to load certain registers or memory addresses.\n\nIn TRACES #2 and #3, after the push ebp, there's a call to 0040E7C3h with an offset from the stack. This suggests another bypass path where the function is called directly from the stack without going through the usual process.\n\nI need to create three different patterns that could represent these bypass sequences. Each pattern should include relevant instructions and use wildcards for address offsets.\n\nFor the first pattern, maybe it's a call with an offset of 0x08. The sequence would be push ebp, mov ebp, call with FF7508.\n\nPattern1: push ebp (0x45), mov ebp, call FF7508.\n\nWait, but in TRACE #2 and #3, the call is from 0040E7F6 to 0040E7C3h. The offset is given by pushing a value into the stack. So maybe the push is of the value, then the call uses that value as the offset.\n\nWait, in the trace:\n\n0040E7FB  59               pop ecx\n0040E7FC  FF7508           push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n>>> 0040E7FF  E8C8FFFFFF       call 0040E7C3h\n\nSo the offset is from [ebp+08], which was pushed as a dword. So the sequence is: mov ebp, push [ebp+8], then call with that value.\n\nWait no, in the code:\n\n- The instruction before the call is FF7508 at 0040E7FB, which pushes something to the stack (dword).\nThen pop ecx, and push again the same dword. Then the call uses that dword as offset.\n\nSo the actual call's offset comes from [ebp+8], so it's a dynamic offset based on the value pushed earlier.\n\nBut in the trace data, the call is E8C8FFFFFF, which is a 32-byte address? Wait no, E8C8FFFFFF is a 64-bit address (since FFFFFFFF is 32 hex digits). So that would be a displacement of 0x1C8FFFF.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is to find the sequence where a function call uses an offset derived from the stack or specific register values.\n\nSo for each trace:\n\nTRACE #1: Call with offset FF7508 (from [ebp+08])\nTRACE #2 and #3: Call after pushing some value into [ebp+08], which becomes the offset.\n\nBut in TRACE #2, the call is E8C8FFFFFF, which could be a displacement. The offset is 0x1C8FFFF? That might not make sense if it's trying to get a specific value from the stack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the push before the call is of 0x08 (which would be hex 08), and then the call uses that as an offset.\n\nWait no, in the trace for TRACE #2:\n\nAfter pop ecx, they push again FF7508. So maybe the instruction before was a push of some value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is: push ebp, mov ebp, call with offset 0x08 (from [ebp+08]).\n\nBut looking at the instructions for each trace:\n\nIn TRACE #1:\n- The call has an explicit offset of FF7508. So that's a direct instruction.\nTRACE #2 and #3: The call uses the value in [ebp+08], which is pushed earlier.\n\nSo possible bypass sequences are either using a fixed offset (like 0x08) or dynamically derived from stack values.\n\nBut since the trace data only shows specific calls, perhaps we can model two different bypass methods:\n\n1. Push ebp, mov ebp, call FF7508\n2. Pop something, push it again to get the offset for the call\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use a conditional jump that's bypassed.\n\nLooking at the test and je instructions in TRACE #1: there are several jz or je jumps. So perhaps one of these was used as an entry point.\n\nBut since all traces terminate early due to sandbox evasion, it's more likely they're using function calls with bypasses rather than direct jumps.\n\nSo I think the two main types of bypass here are:\n\n- Calling a function with a fixed offset (like 0x08)\n- Using stack manipulation to provide an offset for the call\n\nBut given that the traces only show certain instructions, perhaps we can model these as separate patterns.\n\nLet me outline three possible patterns based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\nTo create Yara rules based on the provided trace data, we analyze the instruction sequences involved in potential bypass methods. The rules target different ways malware might attempt to bypass detection by manipulating function calls and stack addresses. Below are the identified patterns:\n\n1. **Fixed Offset Call (0x08):**\n   This pattern involves pushing a value onto the stack with an offset of 0x08, then calling a function from that address.\n\n2. **Dynamic Offset Call:**\n   Here, the malware pushes a value to the stack and uses it as the displacement for a function call, likely after popping necessary registers.\n\n3. **Conditional Jump Bypass:**\n   This involves bypassing conditional jumps (like JE) to skip over detection attempts.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting function calls and jumps\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { \n            54 53 6A ?? 5B ?? 85 C0 8B EC FF75 08 FFFFFFFF \n        } \n        $pattern1 = {\n            54 53 FF 75 08 FFFFFFFF 85 C0 E8C8 FFFF FF FF \n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            6A ?? 5B ?? 8B EC FF75 08 ??\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

The goal is to target specific locations in the code that are likely used for evasion tactics. \n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, there's a lot of calls happening before the exit process. I remember that bypass rules should target where the decision to terminate or execute continues. From the strategies mentioned, Strategy A involves checking early on by matching a call followed by a test and jump instruction.\n\nIn the first attempt, the rule hit but didn't find any new signatures. That suggests that maybe the pattern was too broad or matched at the wrong location. So for this improvement, I need to be more specific about where exactly the bypass is happening.\n\nLooking through the trace data, I notice several places where a call is made followed by a test on EAX and then a jump or conditional jump. For example:\n\n- At offset 0131617A: `test eax, eax`, then je at 01316190h.\n- Another instance at 013161F8: `call dword ptr [0131A12Ch]` followed by a conditional.\n\nThese seem like potential points where the code is making decisions. I can create patterns targeting these specific sequences to bypass them more effectively.\n\nAnother thing to consider is using the exact hex values from the trace for specificity, avoiding wildcards unless necessary. This way, the pattern won't match unintended locations and reduce false positives.\n\nI'll need to extract three different 6-20 byte patterns that target these decision points. Each pattern should include specific instructions like 'call', test, je or conditional jumps with exact offsets if possible.\n\nFinally, I have to structure these into a YARA rule using the required format, making sure each pattern is unique and correctly referenced in the cape_options.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original bypass rule was too broad, causing false positives. By targeting specific decision points (call followed by test and jump), we can more accurately bypass evasion tactics.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns target the exact points where decisions are made to exit or continue execution, ensuring bypass is applied where needed most effectively.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting decision points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0x85C0, 0x7412, 0x6A5B, 0x5A, 0x8BCE, 0xE825050000 }\n        $pattern1 = { 0x83F8, 0x0174, 0x128B, 0x8B4D, 0xF8, 0x5F }\n        $pattern2 = { 0x899DF0FEFFFF, 0x0131619C, 0x8BCE, 0xE874FAFFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        (any of them)\n}\n```",

Let's start by understanding what was done before and where it failed.\n\nIn the first two iterations, the rule hit but didn't find any new signatures. This means that the patterns we used in those attempts were either too broad or matched incorrect locations in the trace. The best clue is to look at the trace provided because all patterns must come from there.\n\nLooking at the original trace for sample bccb7e1c5e7b2162, there are several CALL TEST EAX JE instructions which are typical signs of an evasion check. Strategy A suggests targeting this early in the trace with a 60% success rate. \n\nIn the first iteration, maybe we used a too broad pattern that didn't specify enough details, causing it to match places where the bypass wasn't intended. So, for improvement, I should be more specific about certain bytes but leave others as wildcards.\n\nLooking at the trace, here are some key instructions:\n\n- At 0131617A: test eax, eax\n- Then JE 01316190h\n\nSo a possible pattern is something like TEST EAX, EAX followed by JE. But we need to capture this in the earliest part of the trace.\n\nAnother part of the trace has an E825050000 call which seems significant because it's a specific instruction at 0131667Fh. This could be another bypass point, maybe earlier than previously considered.\n\nAlso, towards the end, there are calls and jumps that might indicate exit points or decisions, so perhaps using those as bypass points would work better if they're targeted correctly.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns from these observations. Each pattern should consist of 6-20 bytes, with specific values where possible and wildcards for variable parts.\n\nFirst Pattern: The initial test and jump.\nSecond Pattern: The call at a certain offset.\nThird Pattern: Another bypass point based on another instruction in the trace.\n\nI need to ensure each is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, the patterns must match specific locations where evasion is likely intended, not just anywhere else.\n\nBy making these changes, I can target more accurate points that are less likely to have matched incorrectly before, thus increasing the confidence of the rule.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe previous attempts using broader patterns matched incorrect locations in the trace. By creating specific 6-byte patterns based on known bypass points from the trace and ensuring each pattern is unique, we increase the accuracy of the bypass detection.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK, CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70-80%\n\n**REASONING**: Patterns are specific to known bypass points in the trace, improving specificity without being too generic.
