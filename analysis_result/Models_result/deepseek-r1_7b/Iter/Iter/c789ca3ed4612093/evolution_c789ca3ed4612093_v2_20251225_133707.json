The main issue is that the pattern starts with E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? ?? and only has two context bytes after. Yara says we need at least four bytes for context to avoid triggering new signatures. That makes sense because without enough bytes, the rule might match too many cases.\n\nLooking at the instructions from TRACE #1, I see that after E8 F7 25, there's an instruction C1 E8 75 10 ?? ?? ?? ?? and another A8 01 8B 40 ?? ?? ?? ?? in the strings section. So maybe these can be turned into patterns with enough context.\n\nI need to create three different patterns from these instructions. Let me start by taking each starting instruction (E8, C1, A8) and include some of their subsequent bytes as context.\n\nFor $pattern0, I'll take E8 F7 25 followed by four wildcard bytes. So it becomes { E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? ?? }.\n\nNext, for $pattern1, starting with C1 E8 75 10 and then adding four wildcards: { C1 E8 75 10 ?? ?? ?? ?? }.\n\nThen, $pattern2 starts with A8 01 8B 40 followed by four wildcards: { A8 01 8B 40 ?? ?? ?? ?? }.\n\nEach pattern is now six bytes long (including the initial instruction and four context bytes), which should meet Yara's requirement of at least six bytes for specificity. I also made sure to keep the opcode and some register bytes concrete, using wildcards only where addresses or offsets are involved.\n\nI think this covers all three necessary points: each pattern is unique, uses enough context to avoid false positives, and follows the correct format with six bytes each.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 F7 25 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { C1 E8 75 10 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { A8 01 8B 40 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any_of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given context and feedback from previous attempts. The task is to create an improved rule by analyzing the trace data and applying some key principles like learning from failures, using momentum, being specific, etc.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided trace data for both TRACES #1 and #2, they seem identical except for minor differences in instruction addresses (like 0041B90C appearing twice). The goal is to find patterns that can bypass the exit process without matching too broadly.\n\nThe original YARA rule has no new signatures, which suggests it's hitting a spot where there are no unique identifiers. I remember that effective bypass rules should target specific instruction sequences that likely lead to program termination but aren't easily matched by other legitimate code.\n\nLooking at the trace, key instructions include calls like E8F7250000 (which is a call to 0041DED2h) and various comparisons and jumps. The exit process seems to be triggered by conditional jumps, so perhaps focusing on these could help.\n\nI should consider Strategy A: Evocation Check, where the bypass happens before an evocation check but after some operations like testing EAX or using JE/JNE. Since the trace includes a TEST EAX (C1E808) and JNE instructions, maybe I can find a pattern that triggers this part of the code.\n\nLooking at the traces, there's a section where EAX is tested with C1E8 (Shr eax, 08h), then A801 (Test al, 01h). If the AL register isn't zero, it jumps to 0041B900h. That seems like an evocation check. So maybe a bypass could be inserted before this point.\n\nAnother area is after the call to E8F7250000 (0041DED2h), which leads into some code that manipulates the stack and registers, followed by conditional jumps based on AL. If I can find an instruction sequence right after the call but before the test and jump, I might create a bypass there.\n\nAlso, looking at Strategy B: Exit Decision, if the exit itself is conditional (like in 0042F1A0h), maybe bypassing that could help. But since previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, perhaps the rule needs to be more specific or placed earlier.\n\nConsidering the patterns from the examples provided, I need to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns using exact hex values from the trace data with wildcards where necessary. Each pattern should target a different part of the code flow that likely leads to termination but isn't commonly used elsewhere.\n\nFor the first pattern (call_test_je), maybe after the call instruction and before the test on EAX, inserting a bypass here could work. For example, right after E8F7250000, if we can find a sequence like 8B45FC (mov eax, ...) followed by a test and jump, that might be a good target.\n\nPattern #1: Maybe the section starting with 64A130000000 (push dword ptr fs:[00000030h]) which pushes an address onto the stack. Then moving to 8B4068 (mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]), followed by C1E808 (shr eax, 08h), and A801 (test al, 01h). If this test is not zero, it jumps to 0041B900h. So a bypass could be inserted right after the test but before the jump.\n\nPattern #2: Another potential spot might be right after FF7508 and before E80B00 (call 0041B913h). Maybe inserting a bypass here would cause it to skip the call, thus bypassing the exit process.\n\nPattern #3: Alternatively, looking at the conditional jumps in the trace, maybe there's another area where an instruction sequence can be triggered. Perhaps after FF75A0F14200 (call 0042F1A0h), which seems to lead into a more complex call structure.\n\nWait, I need to ensure each pattern is specific and unique. Also, using wildcards for varying parts like offsets or addresses can help make the patterns match fewer legitimate cases.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe instead of looking at just the test and jump after EAX, perhaps there's an earlier instruction sequence that's more likely to be bypassed without causing issues elsewhere.\n\nI think I'll outline three distinct sequences:\n\n1. After the initial call (E8F7250000) and right before the EAX test with shr eax, 08h.\n2. Right after pushing the stack offset (64A130000000) and moving to the next instruction.\n3. Before another conditional jump in the code.\n\nEach of these should be specific enough but broad enough to avoid false positives by using exact hex values from the trace with wildcards where needed.\n\nI'll need to map out each pattern's instructions, ensuring they are 6-20 bytes and cover different parts of the code flow. Then, structure them in a YARA rule that skips these bypass points.\n</think>\n\nTo address the issue of generating an improved YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace data and previous attempts, we'll create three distinct patterns targeting specific instruction sequences that are likely to lead to program termination without causing false positives.\n\n### Evolution Reasoning:\nThe previous attempt resulted in a \"Rule hit but no new signatures,\" suggesting the pattern matched at the wrong location or was too broad. By focusing on specific instruction sequences before key points where evocation checks occur, we can create bypass patterns that are more precise and effective.\n\n1. **Call Test Jumps**: Target an instruction sequence right after an evocation check (TEST EAX) before a conditional jump.\n2. **Stack Push Mv**: Bypass instructions following a stack push to avoid execution in legitimate code paths.\n3. **Conditional Call**: Intercept a call leading into another complex instruction set.\n\n### Patterns:\n1. **Call Test Jumps**  \n   Target the sequence after `E8F7250000` (call) and before `A801` (TEST AL, 01h). This bypass triggers right after the test but before the jump.\n   \n   ```yara\n   { 64A130000000 (push dword ptr fs:[00000030h])\n     8B4068          (mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h])\n     C1E808         (shr eax, 08h)\n     A801           (test al, 01h)\n     FF7508        (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Stack Push Mv**  \n   Intercept the stack manipulation right after pushing an address and before the next instruction.\n   \n   ```yara\n   { E8F7250000 (call 0041DED2h)\n     FF7508       (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n     FF153CF14200 (call dword ptr [0042F13Ch])\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Conditional Call**  \n   Target the call leading into a more complex instruction set, intercepting before execution.\n\n### YARA Rule:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specifically targeting evocation checks and conditional calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [45 7E 6A 9C 83 FF] }\n        $pattern1 = { [E8 F7 25 00 00 00, FF 75 08, FF 15 3C F1 42 00] }\n        $pattern2 = { [64 A1 30 00 00 00 00, 8B 40 68, C1 E8 08, A8 01] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and feedback. Let's start by understanding what we have so far.\n\nThe user provided the trace data where two ExitProcess calls are made at 0041B90C with some similar patterns before that. The current best rule has no new signatures, which means it's not specific enough or it's matching in the wrong place.\n\nFrom the previous attempts, the strategies tried were checking the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. But since that didn't yield any new signatures, we need to adjust our approach.\n\nLooking at the trace, each ExitProcess call starts with an E8F7250000 call to some function (probably 0041DED2h). Then, it does a test on EAX and either jumps or continues. So maybe instead of looking in the first 30%, we should check right before the exit call.\n\nIn Strategy B, which has a 25% success rate, we look at the part before the exit. Since the bypass is happening inside the function (like 0041DED2h), our patterns need to target that earlier in the trace.\n\nLet me look for specific instructions in the trace:\n\n- The call to E8F7250000 happens right after moving EAX from some address (00000030h).\n- Then, they test AL with 01h and use JNE or JE.\n- After that, there are some push operations, calls to other functions, etc.\n\nSo maybe the bypass is happening in one of these earlier steps. Let's pick three distinct patterns from different parts:\n\n1. The first pattern could be right after the EAX test where a conditional jump happens. For example, after 0x8B4068 (mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]), then C1E808 (shr eax, 08h), and A801 (test al, 01h) with JNE.\n\n2. The second pattern might be in the function before ExitProcess, like a call to another function that's bypassed first, maybe using RDTSC timing or some other method.\n\n3. For the third pattern, perhaps checking where the program exits after certain operations, like pushing more data and then calling another function with specific offsets.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes, uses exact hex from the trace, and doesn't repeat any patterns. Also, using wildcards for varying addresses or offsets.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nPattern1: After EAX test, right after shr eax,08h and before jne.\nPattern2: Earlier in the trace where a function is called that's bypassed first, maybe involving RDTSC.\nPattern3: Near the exit but checking for specific sequences like pushing data and calling another function.\n\nThis should cover different points in the trace, increasing the chance of matching the correct bypass point without overlapping with previous patterns. I'll make sure to use exact hex values wherever possible and wildcards only where necessary.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The current strategy (Strategy A) didn't yield new signatures because it focused too early in the trace. Strategy B, targeting the exit decision before the call, is more specific and likely to find a bypass point.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK, CMP_SETZ, RDTSC timing\n\n**REASONING**: By focusing on earlier points like after EAX operations and before conditional jumps, we increase specificity without false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeting exit decision\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B4068 ?? ?? ?? ??:C1E8:08 ?? :01:JNE }\n        $pattern1 = { 3D0010:00:00:0F:82 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??:RDTSC ??:VMBN ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 59:POP:ECX ??:??:04:01:00:00:C0 ??:WAIT:00:WAIT ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
