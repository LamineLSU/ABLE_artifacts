      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace data. Let me start by carefully analyzing each trace to identify potential evasion points and generate appropriate patterns.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, I see a call from E8C8FFFF to E7C3h. The surrounding instructions include E8 followed by some bytes. This seems like a candidate for a pattern involving a call instruction with an offset.\n\nIn TRACE #2, the call is at E80D0C0000, which points to 0040E7C3h. Here, the call instruction has a displacement of C0000, but in hex, that's 0x1C0000? Wait, no, looking again, it's E80D0C0000, which is actually 0x40E7C3h. So maybe the call instruction here is E8 followed by some bytes.\n\nTRACE #3 also ends with a call to 0040E7C3h via E8C8FFFFFF. That's similar to TRACE #1 and #2.\n\nNow, looking at the traces where calls are made, I can try to extract patterns that include these call instructions with varying offsets or displacements.\n\nLet me focus on the first few bytes of each trace:\n\nFrom TRACE #4:\n0040E7EE: 8BFF\n0040E7F0: 55 (push ebp)\n0040E7F1: 8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n0040E7F3: FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n0040E7F6: E8C8FFFFFF (call 0040E7C3h)\n\nThis seems like a call instruction with a displacement. The opcode is E8, followed by C8FFFFFF in hex.\n\nFrom TRACE #5:\nSame as TRACE #4 except the end instruction changes to FF15ACB04100 (call 0041B0ACh).\n\nSo both these traces have calls with different displacements: one uses [ebp+08h] and another uses a specific address.\n\nNow, looking at the patterns required:\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes long. I need to combine multiple consecutive instructions into a single pattern, using wildcards for addresses or offsets.\n\nFor example, in TRACE #4, after pushing ebp (55), moving ebp to esp (8BEC), then pushing a dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF7508). Then E8C8FFFFFF is the call instruction. So from FF7508 onward: FF7508, E8, C8, FFFFFFFF.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to capture more context around the target instruction to make the pattern specific enough.\n\nLooking at the first few traces:\n\nIn TRACE #1:\n- Around the target call (E8C8FFFF), we have 8BFF, 55, 8BEC, FF7508 before E8C8FFFF. So perhaps capture these bytes as part of the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in TRACE #2 and #3, similar patterns exist but with different displacements or call destinations.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and captures enough context around the target instruction.\n\nLet me attempt to create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Combines the call from E8C8FFFF, capturing the surrounding push ebp, mov ebp, etc.\n2. Pattern 1: Focuses on a different set of instructions before the call in another trace.\n3. Pattern 2: Another variation using a different displacement or instruction sequence.\n\nI should also ensure that any address/offset bytes are replaced with ?? as per wildcard rules.\n\nLet me draft each pattern step by step, ensuring they fit within 6-20 bytes and include the necessary context around the target call.\n\nPattern 0:\nStarts from FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]), then E8C8FFFF (call). This is a short sequence but may not capture enough. Maybe add preceding instructions like push ebp, mov ebp, etc.\n\nSo Pattern 0 could be: FF7508, E8, C8, FFFFFFFF\nBut let's see:\n\nFF7508 is the instruction for pushing a dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Then E8 is the call opcode with a displacement of C8FFFF. So combining these into one pattern.\n\nBut FF7508 plus E8C8FFFF would be 6 bytes, which fits the requirement.\n\nPattern 0: {FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF}\n\nWait, but FF7508 is \"push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\", then E8 is \"call\", and C8FFFF is the displacement. So this pattern is correct as it captures the call with an offset.\n\nPattern 1: Let's look at another trace where a different displacement or instruction sequence occurs. Maybe from TRACE #2, which ends with FF15ACB04100 (call 0041B0ACh). But perhaps that's too specific; maybe it's better to use a generic call.\n\nAlternatively, using the same E8C8FFFF as in Pattern 0 but changing some bytes. Wait, but both displacements are similar but different: C3h and B0ACh. So another pattern could be from another trace with a different displacement.\n\nWait, perhaps I can take FF7508, E8, followed by any displacement byte. But to make it generic, replace the displacement bytes with ??.\n\nSo Pattern 1: {FF7508 E8 ????}\n\nBut wait, that's only 6 bytes (including FF, E8, and four displacement bytes). It might be better to include more surrounding context for specificity.\n\nAlternatively, combining push ebp, mov ebp, FF7508, then E8C8FFFF.\n\nSo Pattern1: {FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF}\n\nWait, that's the same as Pattern0. So I need a different instruction sequence.\n\nLooking back at the traces:\n\nIn TRACE #4 and #5, after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], we have E8C8FFFF or FF15ACB04100.\n\nPerhaps another pattern could be from a different trace where the call is made with a different displacement. For example, if any other trace has a call with a different displacement, but I don't see that in the provided data except for the two displacements of C3h and B0ACh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different approach: a conditional jump or another instruction sequence leading to a call.\n\nWait, looking at TRACE #2:\n\nThe call is at E8C8FFFF (which is 41F8 in hex). But that's similar to the others. Maybe another trace doesn't have such a call. Alternatively, perhaps focusing on another part of the code where an instruction sequence is followed by a call.\n\nAlternatively, think about other calls: maybe the initial call at E80D0C0000 (from TRACE #2) which is 0x40E7C3h.\n\nWait, I can try to capture that as another pattern.\n\nSo Pattern1 could be:\n\n8BFF (mov edi, edi)\n55 (push ebp)\n8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\nFF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\nE8C8FFFF (call 0040E7C3h)\n\nBut that's more than 6 bytes. Alternatively, as a pattern: FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF\n\nWait, but Pattern1 could be similar to Pattern0. I need them to be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another trace uses a different opcode before the call, like E9 or something else? Looking at the traces:\n\nIn TRACE #3 and #4: the initial instruction after call is mov esp, ebp (8BE5), then ret (C3). But that's not useful for bypassing.\n\nWait, maybe in another part of the code, there's a different instruction before the call. For example, perhaps an E9 followed by something else before the call.\n\nBut I don't have such data here. Alternatively, think about combining multiple instructions leading up to the call.\n\nAlternatively, since all these traces involve calls with similar structures, maybe use a generic call pattern where displacement is replaced with ??\n\nSo Pattern1: {FF7508 E8 ????}\n\nThat's 6 bytes (FF7508 is four bytes, E8 is one byte, then four displacement bytes). So total of 9 bytes.\n\nBut the displacement can vary, so this could be a valid pattern.\n\nPattern2: Maybe another call with different displacement or different opcode before the call. For example, if any trace has an E9 followed by some bytes and then a call, I can create a pattern from that.\n\nLooking back at the traces:\n\nNo such data is present, but perhaps using the first part of a trace where there's an instruction other than push before the call.\n\nAlternatively, think about another approach: focusing on the specific call in TRACE #5 which has FF15ACB04100 (call 0x41B0ACh). But that might be too specific unless I can find similar patterns elsewhere.\n\nBut since all these calls are to 0040E7C3h, maybe it's better to keep the displacement as a wildcard in the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using another type of instruction before the call. For example, if any trace starts with a different instruction like E9 followed by something else and then the call.\n\nBut without such data, I'll have to rely on what's present.\n\nSo, considering that all the traces involve calls after push ebp or similar steps, maybe Pattern1 can use FF7508 as part of it but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, think about combining E9 with something else before the call. But since I don't have such data, perhaps focusing on the known patterns.\n\nLet me try to outline three distinct patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Capture a call from E8C8FFFF (41F8 displacement) after push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So bytes are FF7508, E8, C8, FFFFFFFF. That's 6 bytes.\n\nPattern 1: Another call with different displacement or similar. Let's say we have a call to 0040E7C3h via a different displacement, like in TRACE #2 and #3. So the pattern would be FF7508, E8, C3 (hex). But that's only 6 bytes.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use a wildcard for the displacement: FF7508, E8, ?????\n\nThat would make it {FF7508 E8 ????}\n\nWhich is 9 bytes and captures any displacement call after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h].\n\nPattern2: Perhaps another scenario where the call is made differently. For example, if there's a different instruction before the call, like E9 followed by something.\n\nBut since I don't have such data, maybe use a generic approach with more context around the target call.\n\nWait, looking back at the traces:\n\nIn TRACE #4: After the call, it does 8BE5 (mov esp, ebp), then C3 (ret). So perhaps capturing these after the call might help in creating another pattern. But that's not directly useful for bypassing unless I can find a scenario where this sequence is present before the target instruction.\n\nAlternatively, think about using the E9 instruction followed by some bytes and then a call. Since I don't have such data, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps focus on the known patterns with calls after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], capturing those as separate patterns.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nPattern0: {FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF} (6 bytes)\nPattern1: {FF7508 E8 ????} (9 bytes, using wildcards for displacement)\nPattern2: Maybe a different call with a different displacement or instruction before the call. Since I don't have such data, perhaps create another pattern from a different part of the code.\n\nWait, looking at TRACE #4 and #5 again:\n\nIn both cases, after the call, it does 8BE5 (mov esp, ebp) then C3 (ret). So if there's an instruction sequence like E8 <displacement> followed by some instructions before moving esp and retting. Maybe that can be part of another pattern.\n\nSo for Pattern2, perhaps capture E8C8FFFF or FF15ACB04100 along with the 8BE5 C3 after it.\n\nBut since I don't have similar data in other traces, this might not be reliable. Alternatively, focus on capturing more surrounding context around the call.\n\nAnother approach: Since all these calls are to the same address (0x40E7C3h), maybe create a pattern that includes any displacement leading up to it with wildcards for opcode and displacement.\n\nFor example:\n\n8B ?? (mov edi, edi)\n55 (push ebp)\n8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\nFF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\nE8 ???? (call ???)\n\nSo the pattern would be: {8B 55 8BEC FF7508 E8 ????}\n\nBut that's too long. Alternatively, focus on a specific part.\n\nWait, considering that all these calls are after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], maybe we can create patterns around this:\n\nPattern0: FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF (6 bytes)\nPattern1: FF7508 E8 ???? (9 bytes with wildcards)\nPattern2: 8B ?? 55 8BEC FF7508 E8 ???? \n\nBut that's too long and might not be necessary. Alternatively, focus on the first few instructions leading up to the call.\n\nWait, another thought: in some traces, after the call, there are mov esp, ebp (8BE5) followed by ret (C3). So perhaps capturing these as well would make the pattern more specific. For example:\n\nIn TRACE #4 and #5:\nE8 <displacement>\n8BE5\nC3\n\nSo maybe Pattern2 could be {E8 ???? 8BE5 C3}\n\nThat's 6 bytes.\n\nPutting it all together, I have three patterns now:\n\nPattern0: FF7508 E8 C8 FFFFFFFF (6 bytes)\nPattern1: FF7508 E8 ???? (9 bytes with wildcards for displacement)\nPattern2: E8 ???? 8BE5 C3 (6 bytes)\n\nEach pattern is unique and captures enough context around the target call instruction, using wildcards where necessary.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided traces, three distinct patterns have been identified that capture the necessary context around the target call instructions. These patterns are designed to be specific enough for a bypass attempt while adhering to the requirement of using wildcards for address or offset bytes.\n\n```yara\n# Patterns generated by analyze.py\n\n# Pattern 0: A call instruction with a displacement\n{0xE8, 0xFF, 0xC8, 0x1FFF, 0x85}\n# This pattern captures a call to 0040E7C3h with an offset of C8FFFF.\n\n# Pattern 1: A generic call instruction with wildcards for displacement\n{0xE8, 0xFF, 0x9F, [0x0-0xFF], [0x0-0xFF], [0x0-0xFF], [0x0-0xFF]}\n# This pattern captures any call instruction following a push dword ptr [ebp+08h].\n\n# Pattern 2: A conditional jump followed by a return\n{[0x415E, 0x7F, 0x3C], [0x0-0xFF], 0x95, 0xE5, 0xC3}\n# This pattern captures any instruction sequence starting with E8 and leading to mov esp, ebp followed by ret.\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a Yara bypass rule based on the given trace data. The task is to extract three different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided. There are five traces where different procedures call functions like E7C3h and E7FFh. Each trace shows a series of instructions leading up to a call or jump instruction.\n\nI remember that Yara rules use patterns to match specific sequences of bytes in the binary. For bypass rules, these patterns should target points where the code is trying to evade detection by changing addresses or using wildcards for unknown offsets.\n\nLooking at the examples given, like TEST EAX with JZ and moving something else, it's about combining multiple instructions into one pattern. Each instruction contributes a byte or two, so I need to find sequences of 6-20 bytes that include opcode and register encodings but replace address/offsets with ??.\n\nIn the first trace, the call is at 0x40E7C3h: 8B EC E8 C8 FFFFFFFF. So maybe a pattern could be something like 8B EC E8 followed by some wildcards for the offset. But wait, the offset after E8 is usually four bytes. So perhaps I can create a pattern that captures this.\n\nLooking at another trace where the call is to E7C3h: 0x40E7C3. The instruction sequence might be something like 55 EB 8B EC E8 FF C8 FFFFFFFF, but again focusing on specific parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should pick three different points from the traces where there are clear sequences leading to calls or jumps with wildcards.\n\nLet me try extracting patterns:\n\n1. From the first trace: The call is at 0x40E7C3h, which has the instruction sequence E8 C8 FFFFFFFF. So maybe I can create a pattern that includes E8 followed by four wildcards for the offset and some surrounding context.\n\n2. Another point could be where there's a conditional jump or a TEST instruction from the trace data. For example, looking at the second trace, it uses 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? after a 75 instruction. Maybe I can combine that with other instructions to form another pattern.\n\n3. The third pattern might come from a different part of the trace where there's a series of instructions like PUSH and POP combined into one context for the bypass.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique, uses wildcards appropriately, and includes enough context so it's specific but not too long (6-20 bytes).\n\nLet me try writing three patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 1: Covers the call at E7C3h with some surrounding instructions.\n   - Example: 55 EB 8B EC E8 FF C8 FFFFFFFF becomes 55 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B EC E8 ?? ???? ???\n   \n2. Pattern 2: Includes a conditional jump like 75 ?? and some subsequent instructions.\n   - Maybe something like 74 ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B CE E8 ?? ????\n\n3. Pattern 3: A series of instructions involving PUSH, POP, and TEST with wildcards for the offset bytes.\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards where applicable. Also, no duplicate patterns.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. First pattern could be from a call instruction:\n   E8 C8 followed by four wildcards: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. Need to include more context. Maybe the instruction before is a 75 (conditional jump), so something like 75 ?? E8 ?? ?? ??.\n\nWait, looking back at trace #3:\n\nThe call is at 0x40E7FFh: FF C8 FFFFFFFF in E8C8FFFF. So maybe the pattern can be built around that.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll craft three distinct patterns each targeting different evasions points with appropriate wildcards.\n</think>\n\nHere's a corrected Yara bypass rule based on the analysis of the provided trace data:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion_Patterns\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 ?? 8B EC E8 ?? ???? }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ??? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to generate a Yara bypass rule based on the given trace data. The task is to extract three different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided. There are five traces where different procedures call functions like E7C3h and E7FFh. Each trace shows a series of instructions leading up to a call or jump instruction.\n\nI remember that Yara rules use patterns to match specific sequences of bytes in the binary. For bypass rules, these patterns should target points where the code is trying to evade detection by changing addresses or using wildcards for unknown offsets.\n\nLooking at the examples given, like TEST EAX with JZ and moving something else, it's about combining multiple instructions into one pattern. Each instruction contributes a byte or two, so I need to find sequences of 6-20 bytes that include opcode and register encodings but replace address/offsets with ??.\n\nIn the first trace, the call is at 0x40E7C3h: 8B EC E8 C8 FFFFFFFF. So maybe a pattern could be something like 8B EC E8 followed by some wildcards for the offset. But wait, the offset after E8 is usually four bytes. So perhaps I can create a pattern that captures this.\n\nLooking at another trace where the call is to E7C3h: 0x40E7C3. The instruction sequence might be something like 55 EB 8B EC E8 FF C8 FFFFFFFF, but again focusing on specific parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should pick three different points from the traces where there are clear sequences leading to calls or jumps with wildcards.\n\nLet me try extracting patterns:\n\n1. From the first trace: The call is at 0x40E7C3h, which has the instruction sequence E8 C8 FFFFFFFF. So maybe I can create a pattern that includes E8 followed by four wildcards for the offset and some surrounding context.\n\n2. Another point could be where there's a conditional jump or a TEST instruction from the trace data. For example, looking at the second trace, it uses 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? after a 75 instruction. Maybe I can combine that with other instructions to form another pattern.\n\n3. The third pattern might come from a different part of the trace where there's a series of instructions like PUSH and POP combined into one context for the bypass.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique, uses wildcards appropriately, and includes enough context so it's specific but not too long (6-20 bytes).\n\nLet me try writing three patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 1: Covers the call at E7C3h with some surrounding instructions.\n   - Example: 55 EB 8B EC E8 FF C8 FFFFFFFF becomes 55 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B EC E8 ?? ???? ???\n   \n2. Pattern 2: Includes a conditional jump like 75 ?? and some subsequent instructions.\n   - Maybe something like 74 ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B CE E8 ?? ????\n\n3. Pattern 3: A series of instructions involving PUSH, POP, and TEST with wildcards for the offset bytes.\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards where applicable. Also, no duplicate patterns.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. First pattern could be from a call instruction:\n   E8 C8 followed by four wildcards: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nBut that's only 5 bytes. Need to include more context. Maybe the instruction before is a 75 (conditional jump), so something like 75 ?? E8 ?? ?? ??.\n\nWait, looking back at trace #3:\n\nThe call is at 0x40E7FFh: FF C8 FFFFFFFF in E8C8FFFF. So maybe the pattern can be built around that.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll craft three distinct patterns each targeting different evasions points with appropriate wildcards.\n</think>\n\nHere's a corrected Yara bypass rule based on the analysis of the provided trace data:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion_Patterns\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 55 ?? 8B EC E8 ?? ???? }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ??? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
