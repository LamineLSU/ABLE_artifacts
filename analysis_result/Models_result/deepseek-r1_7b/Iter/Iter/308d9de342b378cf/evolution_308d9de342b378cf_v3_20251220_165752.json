      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help create a Yara rule based on the given trace data for an evasion bypass. From what I understand, the attacker is trying to bypass certain checks implemented by the defender's system. My job is to figure out where these checks are and how they can be skipped.\n\nLooking at the traces, each one has several instructions that seem to represent checks. For example, there are a lot of 85 C0 followed by other bytes, which I remember in Yara translates to TEST EAX. Then after that, an 8B (which is a mov instruction), and then some FFFF FF... This pattern repeats multiple times across different traces.\n\nSo the first thing I notice is that these TEST EAX instructions are followed by a conditional jump or something similar, which might be checking the result of the test. The attacker probably wants to bypass this check by skipping over certain instructions.\n\nIn the trace data, after each 85 C0 (TEST EAX), there's an 8B instruction, like moving from EBP to ESI or something. Then comes a conditional jump with FFFF FF... which might be a jump if not equal (JNE) or similar. If I can skip these instructions, the test won't execute, and the attacker can proceed.\n\nLooking at one of the traces:\n\n0040E7EE 8BFF\n0040E7F0 55\n0040E7F1 8BEC\n0040E7F3 FF7508\n>>> 0040E7F6 E8C8FFFFFF call ...\nSo after EBP is moved, there's a FFFF F... which seems like a jump. If I can skip the mov and then somehow bypass the jump or make it not execute, that would work.\n\nWait, maybe instead of moving EBP to ESI (which is 0x0800ffff), if I can just skip pushing EBP and then directly call without doing the move, that might work. But in this trace, there's a call at 0040E7C3h, which seems to be after the FFFF check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker is using a different technique like bypassing the stack manipulation or using a direct instruction to jump over these checks.\n\nAnother thought: looking for a place where the mov from EBP could be skipped. If the instruction before the test allows for pushing without doing anything (maybe a no-op), but that's not likely in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an 8BEC instruction which is pushing EBP onto ESP with some value. If I can skip that push and then proceed to call, bypassing the FFFF check would allow execution to reach the target code.\n\nSo putting it all together, a possible bypass pattern could be:\n\n1. The test (85 C0), followed by skipping the mov from EBP.\n2. Then somehow bypassing or overwriting the instruction that leads to the conditional jump.\n\nBut how can I represent this in Yara? It should combine multiple instructions into one pattern with wildcards for address bytes.\n\nLooking at the first trace, after 8BEC (push ebp), there's FF7508 which is pushing a dword. Then comes E8C8FFFFFF which is calling something. So maybe if I can skip pushing EBP and then somehow make that conditional jump not happen or be skipped.\n\nBut it's tricky because the FFFF instructions are part of the check flow. Maybe another approach: after 8BEC, instead of moving, we can directly call without doing anything else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an instruction like a direct jump over those checks.\n\nWait, but in Yara, you need to build patterns that match these sequences with wildcards for address/offset bytes. So I'll have to find which instructions correspond to the attacker's bypass path and include them in the pattern.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn one of the traces at 0040E7F6: E8C8FFFFFF is a call, but before that, there was FF7508 which pushes a dword. So maybe if I can skip pushing that dword, then the next instruction (the call) would execute as if it's from EBP.\n\nBut how to represent this? Maybe by using wildcards for those address bytes after the mov.\n\nAnother idea: If the attacker is able to bypass the mov ebp and then proceed directly to the target code, maybe by using a different stack depth or a no-op push.\n\nWait, perhaps the attacker can just push nothing (using 0x08) instead of EBP + something. Then when the conditional jump expects a certain offset, it might not match, but if the attacker can manipulate the instruction before that to avoid the check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to bypass the FFFF instructions by using a different instruction sequence.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about how Yara patterns work. Each pattern is built from consecutive instructions with wildcards for any address or offset bytes.\n\nSo perhaps one pattern would capture:\n\n- 85 C0 (TEST EAX)\n- 8BEC (push ebp to esp with some value, but the attacker wants to skip this)\n- FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n- Then a call...\n\nBut how can I make it so that after pushing, the conditional jump doesn't execute? Maybe by making sure that the next instruction is not a conditional jump.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps bypassing the FFFF instructions entirely. For example, using a different instruction after 8BEC to avoid the check.\n\nWait, maybe using an unconditional branch instead of a conditional one would help. But in this trace, I don't see any unconditional branches mentioned.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe there's a way to call directly from EBP without going through the FFFF instructions. For example, if the code is calling via a different address or using a different instruction set.\n\nBut looking at the trace data, after 8BEC (push ebp), it's followed by FF7508 which pushes another value onto the stack, then E8C8FFFFFF which is a call with an offset. So maybe if I can bypass pushing EBP and directly make that call as a direct jump.\n\nSo putting this together, perhaps one pattern could be:\n\n85 C0 (TEST EAX)\n8BEC (push ebp to esp)\nFF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\nE8C8FFFFFF (call ...)\n\nBut the attacker might want to bypass these by using a different instruction after 8BEC.\n\nWait, but in Yara, you can't really change which instruction is next. So maybe instead of pushing EBP and then making that call with an offset, we can find a way to make it as if the instruction after is being called directly from EBP.\n\nAlternatively, using wildcards for the push's displacement so that any value is considered, allowing bypass.\n\nBut I'm not sure how effective that would be. Maybe instead, targeting the mov instruction before the test.\n\nWait, another idea: If there's an 8BEC (push ebp) followed by FFFF00FF which checks if EBP is non-zero. So if we can skip pushing EBP and directly proceed to the call, bypassing that check.\n\nSo perhaps a pattern would be:\n\n85 C0\n8BEC (push ebp)\nFF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\nE8C8FFFFFF (call ...)\n\nBut how to represent this in Yara with wildcards. Maybe by using 8BEC followed by FF7508 and E8... but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the push ebp can be replaced with something else, like a no-op or another value for EBP.\n\nWait, if after 8BEC (push ebp), we have FF7508 which is pushing another dword. So perhaps if we can replace the instruction at that position with a different one, bypassing the conditional jump.\n\nBut I don't know what exact displacement to use without more context.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try looking for other places where the test (85 C0) is followed by something else.\n\nWait, in another trace:\n\n0040E7F6: E8C8FFFFFF call ...\nSo perhaps the attacker can bypass pushing EBP and then proceed to that call directly.\n\nIf I can find a way to represent this as skipping 8BEC (push ebp), but still making the call happen. Maybe using a different instruction before or after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an instruction like 0x85C0 0x8BEC 0xFF7508 E8C8FFFFFF which can be replaced with something else.\n\nWait, another thought: If I can find a place where the push ebp (8BEC) is followed by a conditional jump. So bypassing that by replacing it with an unconditional branch or modifying the offset to always succeed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a different instruction before 8BEC to avoid pushing EBP and then proceed directly.\n\nI'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should look for patterns where after TEST EAX comes an instruction that can be bypassed, like a jump with a fixed offset or an unconditional branch.\n\nWait, looking at the initial trace:\n\n0040E7EE 8BFF\n0040E7F0 55 (push ebp)\n0040E7F1 8BEC (mov ebp, esp)\n0040E7F3 FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n>>> 0040E7F6 E8C8FFFFFF call ...\n\nSo the attacker can bypass this by pushing something else and then making that call. But how to represent this in a Yara pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different displacement for FF7508 so it doesn't match any valid value.\n\nBut without knowing what exactly is being pushed after, it's hard to create a specific wildcard.\n\nWait, another idea: If I can make the 8BEC instruction (push ebp) have an arbitrary offset, then when followed by a push with FF7508, which is also an arbitrary displacement. So perhaps using wildcards for both displacements would bypass any specific checks on EBP or the next operand.\n\nSo maybe a Yara pattern like:\n\n85 C0\n8BEC (push ebp) <any>\nFF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp + 0x08]) <any>\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, perhaps using a no-op before the push to prevent any manipulation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attacker is using a different instruction altogether instead of moving EBP, like just pushing a dummy value or nothing at all.\n\nWait, but without more context on how exactly the test and conditional jump work, it's challenging to create an accurate Yara pattern. However, given that these are common checks (like checking if EBP was non-zero), bypassing them by replacing those instructions with others would be effective.\n\nSo putting this together, I think three possible patterns could be:\n\n1. Bypass the TEST EAX and conditional jump:\n   - 85 C0\n   - 8BEC (push ebp) with any displacement\n   - FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+any])\n   - Call ... but how to represent this as a single pattern.\n\nBut wait, in Yara, each instruction is consecutive. So perhaps the pattern would capture from after 85 C0 up to E8C8FFFFFF with wildcards for any addresses or offsets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to break it down into separate patterns targeting specific locations where the test and conditional jump occur.\n\nSo Pattern 1: Bypassing after TEST EAX by replacing push ebp:\n   - 8BEC\n   - Wildcard displacement (0x08)\n   - Then proceed with the call\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact instruction sequence. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler pattern would be to replace the mov instruction before the test, so that the test doesn't execute at all. But looking at the trace data, the test is followed by 8BEC (push ebp). So maybe if I can skip pushing EBP and then proceed normally.\n\nBut without knowing what comes after, it's hard to create a precise pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an unconditional jump or move instruction before the test to avoid executing it altogether.\n\nI think at this point, I need to outline three potential Yara patterns based on these observations. Each would target different parts of the code where the attacker might be bypassing checks by manipulating stack pushes and displacements with wildcards.\n</think>\n\nTo address the evasion bypass identified in the trace data, we can create three Yara rules targeting different locations where the attacker may have bypassed checks by manipulating stack operations and displacements.\n\n**Yara Rule 1: Bypassing after TEST EAX**\n```yara\n0x85C0     # TEST EAX\n0x8BEC     # Push ebp to esp (displacement can vary)\n0xFF7508   # Push dword ptr [ebp+08h] with any displacement\nE8C8FFFFFF # Call ... but as a direct jump due to bypassed checks\n```\nThis rule captures the sequence where the attacker skips pushing EBP and then proceeds directly to the target call, effectively bypassing the conditional check.\n\n**Yara Rule 2: Unconditional Branch After TEST EAX**\n```yara\n0x85C0     # TEST EAX\n0x8BEC     # Push ebp to esp (could be any displacement)\nE9D101    # Unconditional branch instead of a conditional jump\n```\nThis rule targets scenarios where the attacker uses an unconditional branch after the test, preventing the conditional check from executing.\n\n**Yara Rule 3: Bypassing Conditional Jump**\n```yara\n0x8BEC     # Push ebp to esp (displacement can vary)\n0xFF7508   # Push dword ptr [ebp+08h] with any displacement\nE8C8FFFFFF # Call ... as if from EBP due to bypassed push\n```\nThis rule focuses on bypassing the conditional jump by pushing without specific displacements, ensuring the call proceeds as intended.\n\nThese rules provide a framework for detecting potential bypass attempts in similar contexts.",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to create a Yara rule based on the provided trace data. The goal is to extract three bypass patterns that can exploit certain checks implemented by the malware author.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, I notice several calls and instructions related to memory access and stack manipulation. The attacker seems to be evading detection by manipulating these areas.\n\nIn Phase 1, from the attacker's perspective, they might be checking for specific instruction sequences that bypass sandboxing or VM protection. For example, calling functions that push and pop values on the stack in a way that doesn't trigger the eviction mechanism.\n\nMoving to Phase 2, as a defender, I need to identify where the attacker can insert bypasses without triggering their checks. Memory access instructions like `8B 45` (push word) or `0F C4` (pop word) could be points of attack since they might be used to create stack entries that bypass eviction.\n\nIn Phase 3, analyzing each potential bypass point, I consider how the attacker can skip certain checks. For instance, if a conditional jump is skipped by using an unconditional one, it might bypass the detection.\n\nNow, focusing on the trace data:\n\n- The first call at `FF15ACB04100` (0x0041b0ac) might be evading a check that expects certain argument lengths.\n- The second call at `FF15C8C3` could be another bypass point, perhaps for a different type of argument length.\n- Another call at `FF15ACB04100` again suggests repetition in the bypass patterns.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns. Each pattern should include the target instruction and surrounding context with wildcards where necessary.\n\nPattern 1: Combining `8B 45 FC (push word)` and a conditional jump `74 ??`. This could bypass an argument length check.\nPattern 2: A longer sequence involving multiple instructions, like a stack push followed by a call, to avoid detection.\nPattern 3: A different instruction sequence that also evades the checks.\n\nFinally, ensuring each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long and replacing all address/offsets with `??` as per wildcard rules. Also, making sure each pattern is unique and doesn't duplicate any previous ones.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting memory access and stack manipulation\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 45 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

So, let's start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces from different phases of execution (Phases 1-6), it seems that each phase has similar patterns where certain instructions are called or jumped to, followed by a test (like TEST EAX) and then some conditional jumps. The goal is probably to bypass these checks so that the program exits instead of being detected.\n\nSo, from Phase 1, the attacker's perspective would be trying to implement evasions against sandboxing or analysis tools. They might have added checks like TEST EAX, JZX (Jump If Zero Extended), and a conditional jump based on EAX not being zero. The idea is that if these conditions are met, execution continues; otherwise, it exits.\n\nIn Phase 2 for the defender, they need to find places where they can skip instructions without failing the check. For example, if they can bypass the TEST EAX by either making EAX zero or non-zero in a way that allows the next conditional jump (like JNB) to proceed regardless of the previous check.\n\nIn Phase 3, it's about how these evasions are analyzed and whether specific bypasses work against various scenarios. The goal is to make sure each bypass is robust enough but still specific so that they don't break legitimate code.\n\nNow, moving on to creating the YARA rule with exactly three patterns based on the trace data. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, include context bytes after calls or jumps for wildcards, and be different from each other.\n\nLooking at the trace, in Phase 1, there's a call to E8C8FFFFFF followed by a call to FF15ACB04100. This seems like a key point where an evasion check might occur before this call. Similarly, in Phases 2 and 6, the same call is made after similar checks.\n\nSo, for each phase, I can create a pattern that captures these calls with surrounding context to bypass any specific tests.\n\nLet me try constructing three different patterns:\n\n1. The first could be around the initial call from Phase 1: E8C8FFFFFF followed by FF15ACB04100.\n2. The second might come after some additional stack manipulation, perhaps involving 6A and 5A bytes before the main call.\n3. The third could target a different part of the code, maybe combining more nearby instructions.\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern includes the specific instruction (like E8 or FF) followed by enough context with wildcards where applicable. Also, I should keep opcode and register encodings concrete while replacing address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nAfter considering all this, here's how I might structure the three patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Starts with E8C8FFFFFF and includes the next instruction FF15ACB04100.\nPattern 1: Includes a different sequence like 6A followed by some operations before the main call.\nPattern 2: Combines another set of instructions from later in the trace.\n\nNow, applying wildcards where necessary and ensuring each pattern is unique. I'll also make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass for specific memory checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??}\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a YARA rule based on the given trace data and the adversarial analysis strategy. So, let's start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces from different phases of execution (Phases 1-6), it seems that each phase has similar patterns where certain instructions are called or jumped to, followed by a test (like TEST EAX) and then some conditional jumps. The goal is probably to bypass these checks so that the program exits instead of being detected.\n\nSo, from Phase 1, the attacker's perspective would be trying to implement evasions against sandboxing or analysis tools. They might have added checks like TEST EAX, JZX (Jump If Zero Extended), and a conditional jump based on EAX not being zero. The idea is that if these conditions are met, execution continues; otherwise, it exits.\n\nIn Phase 2 for the defender, they need to find places where they can skip instructions without failing the check. For example, if they can bypass the TEST EAX by either making EAX zero or non-zero in a way that allows the next conditional jump (like JNB) to proceed regardless of the previous check.\n\nIn Phase 3, it's about how these evasions are analyzed and whether specific bypasses work against various scenarios. The goal is to make sure each bypass is robust enough but still specific so that they don't break legitimate code.\n\nNow, moving on to creating the YARA rule with exactly three patterns based on the trace data. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, include context bytes after calls or jumps for wildcards, and be different from each other.\n\nLooking at the trace, in Phase 1, there's a call to E8C8FFFFFF followed by a call to FF15ACB04100. This seems like a key point where an evasion check might occur before this call. Similarly, in Phases 2 and 6, the same call is made after similar checks.\n\nSo, for each phase, I can create a pattern that captures these calls with surrounding context to bypass any specific tests.\n\nLet me try constructing three different patterns:\n\n1. The first could be around the initial call from Phase 1: E8C8FFFFFF followed by FF15ACB04100.\n2. The second might come after some additional stack manipulation, perhaps involving 6A and 5A bytes before the main call.\n3. The third could target a different part of the code, maybe combining more nearby instructions.\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern includes the specific instruction (like E8 or FF) followed by enough context with wildcards where applicable. Also, I should keep opcode and register encodings concrete while replacing address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nAfter considering all this, here's how I might structure the three patterns:\n\nPattern 0: Starts with E8C8FFFFFF and includes the next instruction FF15ACB04100.\nPattern 1: Includes a different sequence like 6A followed by some operations before the main call.\nPattern 2: Combines another set of instructions from later in the trace.\n\nNow, applying wildcards where necessary and ensuring each pattern is unique. I'll also make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass for specific memory checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??}\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
