      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given trace data from a YARA test case to generate three distinct bypass rules targeting suspicious evasion points. Each rule must be 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for addresses or offsets and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace, I notice several places where instructions are being called and conditions are checked. These could be potential spots where an attacker is evading detection by manipulating the flow of execution.\n\nLooking through the first few traces:\n\n- There's a call to 004031E6h with E890000000, which seems like a function being called.\n- In another trace, there's an instruction at 004020FA where it calls 004031E6h again.\n\nI need to extract multiple instructions around these points to form patterns. Let me try combining the call and surrounding context.\n\nLooking closer:\n\nAt 004020FA, the instruction is E890000000 followed by a return (C20800). So maybe the pattern could include the call, the function address, and the return. Alternatively, focusing on how the function is called.\n\nAnother point: In the first trace, after E8B4F503E6h, there's an E9B4FAFFFF which jumps to 00401B49h via jne. That might be another target for a bypass rule since it uses a jump with condition checking.\n\nAlso, in the second trace (TRACE #2), after the call to 004031E6h at 004020FA, there's an E890000000 and then ret. So perhaps this is another target.\n\nWait, but the patterns need to be specific, so maybe focusing on the function calls that are being made and how they're being bypassed.\n\nLooking for instructions where a call is made with a specific displacement or offset, which could indicate an attempt to bypass memory protection or return address manipulation.\n\nAnother observation: The first trace has 83BD04F9FFFF01 at 004020E5. This is a comparison between a dword and 0x01h, followed by jne. Since it's checking against a small value (0x01), perhaps this could be a target for a bypass where the condition isn't met, allowing execution to proceed beyond the check.\n\nAlso, in the second trace (TRACE #2), there's an instruction at 004020E5 with the same comparison. So both traces have similar evasive steps which can form patterns.\n\nNow, let me try constructing the first pattern using the function call and surrounding instructions:\n\nLooking at 004020FA: E890000000 is a call instruction where the offset might be from ebp-3Ch. So combining this with the previous E8B4F503E6h (which I think is calling the same function) and then the return.\n\nWait, but each pattern needs to target different evasion points. Perhaps each of these calls could form a separate rule based on where they're called from or what instruction follows.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on specific steps in the trace that are being used as evasive techniques.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for patterns that include jne followed by a comparison. For instance, 7511 (jne) and then 0x01h check could be a target to bypass.\n\nLooking at the first trace:\n\nAt 004020E5: 83BD04F9FFFF01\nThis is a cmp instruction followed by jne. So if this is being used as an evasive point, perhaps we can create a pattern that includes these instructions and surrounding context.\n\nSimilarly, in the second trace:\n\nAt 004020E5: same as above.\n\nWait, but both traces have similar structures. Maybe I need to find different points where bypass could occur. Alternatively, target different parts of the code flow.\n\nPerhaps each rule can be based on a specific instruction that's being called and then followed by another instruction which is an evasive step.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. The function call at 004020FA (E890000000) followed by return.\n2. The jne check with comparison to 0x01h, which could be bypassed if the value isn't met.\n3. Another point where a call is made and then immediately ret.\n\nBut I need three different patterns. Let's try constructing them:\n\nPattern 1: Combining E890000000 (call) with surrounding context, including the return instruction.\n\nLooking at the first trace after E890000000:\nE8B4F503E6h is a call to another function. So perhaps not directly relevant.\n\nWait, maybe focusing on specific displacements or known addresses where bypass can happen.\n\nAlternatively, looking for instructions that are followed by returns which could indicate an attempt to bypass stack manipulation.\n\nAnother approach: Look at the return address ( ebp + some offset ). If a bypass is happening, the return instruction might be modified. So perhaps include the return address in the pattern with wildcards.\n\nBut given time constraints, I'll try to outline three possible patterns based on different evasive points:\n\n1. Pattern targeting the function call and its return.\n2. Pattern targeting the jne check for 0x01h.\n3. Pattern targeting a call followed by ret but with a different displacement.\n\nI think these should cover distinct bypasses at different points in the code.\n</think>\n\nTo generate three distinct YARA bypass rules based on the analysis of the provided trace data, we focus on identifying key evasive instructions and their surrounding context. Each rule is constructed to target specific evasion points by combining relevant instructions into patterns that include wildcards for address/offset bytes while keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\n### Rule 1: Bypass at the Function Call with Return\nThis rule targets a function call followed by a return instruction, typical in bypassing function execution. It combines the call instruction, its displacement offset (wildcarded), and the subsequent return address manipulation.\n\n**Pattern:**  \n`E890000000 5D ???? ?? ???B4F503E6h C20800`\n\n### Rule 2: Bypass at the Conditional Jump with Offset Check\nThis rule bypasses a conditional jump by targeting the offset calculation before the jump, ensuring the condition is not met. The comparison byte (wildcarded) and the instruction following it are included to match only evasive code.\n\n**Pattern:**  \n`83BD04F9FFFF01 ???? ?? ???? FF C9 C20800`\n\n### Rule 3: Bypass at a Call-Return Sequence\nThis rule targets a call followed by an immediate return, allowing bypass by ensuring the displacement is modified. The call and return instructions are combined with wildcards for address offsets.\n\n**Pattern:**  \n`E81D030000 5A 6A ???? 50 E8B245Bh C706000000 ??`\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Three bypass rules targeting evasive points in code\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E890000000 5D ???? ?? ???B4F503E6h C20800 }\n        $pattern1 = { 83BD04F9FFFF01 ???? ?? ????

The goal is to create an improved rule that can successfully bypass the malware defense mechanisms by focusing on specific points in the trace.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces, I see multiple instances of exit processes and various calls leading up to them. From the evolution history, Strategy A was attempted first with no new signatures found. This suggests that the initial bypass attempt didn't hit a new target, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nThe user's trace analysis shows that exit processes are called at different points in the code. For example, there are calls to E89000000 and E8B8080000, which are likely the exit instructions. The previous attempt tried a bypass strategy targeting these exits but didn't find any new signatures.\n\nNow, according to the principles provided:\n\n1. **Learn from failures**: Since Strategy A didn't yield results, we need to consider moving earlier in the trace or checking for conditional logic before the exit.\n2. **Use momentum**: If certain strategies are working, keep them; if not, adjust.\n3. **Specificity vs. Generality**: Patterns should be specific enough to avoid false positives but general enough to cover variants.\n\nLooking at Strategy B, which focuses on the exit decision before the actual exit call, seems promising since it might catch conditional logic that bypass rules missed earlier.\n\nI'll need to identify patterns in the trace where a decision is made before exiting. For example, looking for condition checks like JZ, JB, or JE followed by an exit instruction could be effective.\n\nFrom the traces provided:\n\n- In TRACE #3, there's a call E8B8080000 which seems to be the exit process.\n- Before that, in lines 004028A6 and onwards, there are calls like E8F3080000 (Strategy B) and other conditional checks.\n\nLet me extract potential patterns from these sections. For example:\n\n1. **Pattern A**: Conditional jump before exit, such as JZ or JE followed by an exit call.\n2. **Pattern B**: Specific instruction sequences that bypass the guard conditions, like using RDTSC timing to avoid VM detection.\n3. **Pattern C**: Memory address checks that can be bypassed with a specific sequence.\n\nI should ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses exact hex values where possible, with wildcards for varying offsets or addresses.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The goal is to create an improved rule that can successfully bypass the malware defense mechanisms by focusing on specific points in the trace.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces, I see multiple instances of exit processes and various calls leading up to them. From the evolution history, Strategy A was attempted first with no new signatures found. This suggests that the initial bypass attempt didn't hit a new target, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nThe user's trace analysis shows that exit processes are called at different points in the code. For example, there are calls to E89000000 and E8B8080000, which are likely the exit instructions. The previous attempt tried a bypass strategy targeting these exits but didn't find any new signatures.\n\nNow, according to the principles provided:\n\n1. **Learn from failures**: Since Strategy A didn't yield results, we need to consider moving earlier in the trace or checking for conditional logic before the exit.\n2. **Use momentum**: If certain strategies are working, keep them; if not, adjust.\n3. **Specificity vs. Generality**: Patterns should be specific enough to avoid false positives but general enough to cover variants.\n\nLooking at Strategy B, which focuses on the exit decision before the actual exit call, seems promising since it might catch conditional logic that bypass rules missed earlier.\n\nI'll need to identify patterns in the trace where a decision is made before exiting. For example, looking for condition checks like JZ, JB, or JE followed by an exit instruction could be effective.\n\nFrom the traces provided:\n\n- In TRACE #3, there's a call E8B8080000 which seems to be the exit process.\n- Before that, in lines 004028A6 and onwards, there are calls like E8F3080000 (Strategy B) and other conditional checks.\n\nLet me extract potential patterns from these sections. For example:\n\n1. **Pattern A**: Conditional jump before exit, such as JZ or JE followed by an exit call.\n2. **Pattern B**: Specific instruction sequences that bypass the guard conditions, like using RDTSC timing to avoid VM detection.\n3. **Pattern C**: Memory address checks that can be bypassed with a specific sequence.\n\nI should ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses exact hex values where possible, with wildcards for varying offsets or addresses. This specificity will help in matching the correct target without false positives.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these patterns into YARA rules, referencing each one appropriately to ensure they are applied correctly.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The initial bypass attempt using Strategy A didn't yield new signatures, indicating that the exit instruction was either not targeted correctly or had conditional logic. Moving to Strategy B, which focuses on the decision before exiting, could capture such conditions. Specific patterns for these decision points will help avoid false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**REASONING**: Patterns targeting the decision before the exit ensure we bypass any conditional checks that might prevent termination.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific exit decision check\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8945D0 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??\n                     E8F3080000\n                     ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A01\n                     FF75D0\n                     FF75D0\n                     E8F7080000 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8945E0 ?? ?? ?? ??\n                     C745F00600 ?? \n                     FF75FC ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
