(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this malware trace that's exiting early due to sandbox evasion. The user provided the trace data for two traces, both ending with an exitProcess call.\n\nLooking at the first trace, it starts at 0040E7EE and ends at 0040E7FF in the second trace. Both have similar steps but differ slightly in the call instruction: one calls 0040E7C3h and then another at 0040E7B0ACh.\n\nFrom the attacker's perspective, they likely implemented some checks to bypass sandbox or VM detection. Maybe they're evading memory protection by checking certain offsets. The attacker probably uses conditions like E8 C8 FFFF (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]) which is a common way to bypass signature analysis.\n\nFor the defender's side, I need to find where the attacker could have inserted bypass code that would allow them to evade detection. Looking at the instructions:\n\nIn both traces, after pushing ebp and moving it into esp with mov ebp, esp, then pushing some data, they call 0040E7C3h. Then in the second trace, they also call another address.\n\nPotential bypass points could be around these calls or the push operations. Maybe if the attacker skips certain instructions that check for signatures before proceeding to make a real call.\n\nSo possible targets might be:\n\n1. The E8 C8 FFFF instruction: this is a common signature byte used in sandboxes, so skipping it would allow the attacker's code to execute.\n2. The 59 pop ecx instruction after pushing ebp: if skipped, maybe they can bypass some checks on ecx.\n3. The FF7508 push instruction before the call: perhaps by manipulating this, but I'm not sure.\n\nEach of these could be points where the attacker inserted a bypass that skips the necessary checks.\n\nFor each target, I need to build patterns with wildcards and combine them with surrounding instructions.\n\nPattern 1 would include E8 C8 FFFF plus any wildcards around it. Pattern 2 might involve moving the registers after pushing, like pop ecx being skipped.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long, includes the target instruction, and uses ?? for address/offsets.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting call signatures\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 FF C8 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from my previous attempts. Let's start by looking at what happened in the first iteration.\n\nIn Iteration 1, the rule hit but didn't find any new signatures. That means whatever pattern I used before was too broad or wasn't placed correctly in the trace. So, I need to adjust it so that it doesn't match as much and is more specific.\n\nLooking at the traces provided, both TRACe #1 and #2 end with a call to ExitProcess at 0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF respectively. The code before these calls has some similar patterns, like pushing ebp and moving edi to ebp. \n\nThe exit process is often handled by specific instructions, so maybe I should focus on finding the exact instruction that triggers the bypass. For example, in Strategy C, which uses RDTSC timing or conditional checks before the exit, but since that didn't work before, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nI remember looking at some patterns where specific bytes are used, like 8B45FC and others. Maybe I can find similar exact sequences from the trace data. \n\nLooking closely at the traces:\n\nIn both cases, after pushing ebp, there's a mov edi, ebp (0x8b4c). Then they push a dword ptr offset from ebp, which is 0x7508. So maybe finding these specific bytes can help.\n\nAnother idea: The call to ExitProcess happens after some conditional checks. Maybe looking for the instruction right before the call that triggers the bypass would be better. For example, if there's an AND or OR operation before the call, that could indicate a decision point where the bypass is applied.\n\nWait, in both traces, after moving edi to ebp and pushing dword ptr, they immediately call ExitProcess. Maybe I can look for a pattern where these steps happen right before the call with specific operands.\n\nAlso, I should consider using wildcards (??) for any address or offset bytes since those might vary depending on how the code is structured.\n\nSo, maybe create three different patterns:\n\n1. The first could be looking for the call to ExitProcess after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So a pattern like 59 (pop ecx), FF7508 (push dword ptr...), and then E8C8FFFFFF (call ExitProcess). \n\n2. Another pattern might focus on the AND or OR operation before the call, which could be earlier in the trace.\n\n3. The third pattern could look for a different instruction sequence right before the call, maybe using CPUID or another instruction that's conditional.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses exact hex values where possible with wildcards for variations.\n\nLet me draft these patterns:\n\nPattern1: Push dword ptr [ebp+08h], then pop ecx, push dword ptr again, call ExitProcess.\nPattern2: AND or OR operation before the call, followed by the same push steps.\nPattern3: Alternative instruction right before the call, maybe using different bytes.\n\nI need to make sure each is distinct and specific enough to match only at the right locations without too many false positives. Also, include all three in the YARA rule with their respective actions (skip) so they don't interfere with each other.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's an improved YARA bypass rule using specific patterns from the trace data:\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous approach used a single broad pattern which matched too often. By creating three distinct and specific 6-byte patterns targeting different points in the call to ExitProcess, we reduce false positives and increase the likelihood of effective bypass.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: Using exact sequences from the trace increases specificity. Each pattern targets a unique instruction sequence right before the ExitProcess call, reducing chances of matching unrelated code.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - specific instruction sequence targeting\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 59 FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern1 = { 0040E7F6 0040E7FF 8BEC FF7508 0040E7FC 59 E8C8FFFFFF }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B45 FC 0040E7F3 FF7508 0040E7FB 59 E8C8FFFFFF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to help generate a corrected YARA rule based on the user's query. Let me go through all the information and errors they've provided.\n\nFirst, from the initial invalid rule, I see that there are three patterns (pattern1, pattern2, pattern3), but each is missing some parts, especially in the third pattern where it ends abruptly with a wildcard without completing the sequence. The validation errors mention two main issues: missing basic YARA structure and missing cape_options.\n\nThe user provided trace data showing two exit process calls with specific instructions before them. Each has around six to seven bytes of context before and after the call instruction, including mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; etc., followed by pushing a value and then a call.\n\nIn their corrected rule, they need exactly three patterns, each 6-20 bytes long. They must use wildcards for address/offset bytes but keep opcode and registers concrete. Also, they have to include the cape_options with breakpoints on each pattern and an action of skip.\n\nI should extract instructions from the trace data that are around six to twenty bytes long, ensuring each is unique. Looking at the traces, each exit process call starts with mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; then pushes a value, followed by E8C8FFFFFF (call 0x0040E7C3h), and then another call or pop.\n\nSo possible patterns could be:\n\n1. The first part up to the call: mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]; E8C8FFFFFF call 0x0040E7C3h\n   That's six bytes plus some context.\n\n2. A variation including more instructions after the first call, maybe moving to another register or using different wildcards.\n\n3. Another pattern could involve a different sequence of instructions before the final call.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and uses wildcards where necessary without hardcoding any addresses. Also, each pattern must reference an offset with ?? since they're wildcards.\n\nLet me draft three patterns:\n\nPattern0: mov edi, edi; push ebp; mov ebp, esp; FF7508; E8C8FFFFFF (call)\nPattern1: 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? (some unique sequence)\nPattern2: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (for the second call)\n\nWait, but I need to make sure each is 6-20 bytes. Let me structure them properly with wildcards and opcodes.\n\nAfter considering all these points, here's how I can structure the three patterns:\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from the previous attempts. The goal is to bypass a piece of malware by exploiting certain behaviors in the code execution.\n\nFirst, looking at the history, the initial rule hit but didn't generate any new signatures, which means it's probably matching the wrong place or not specific enough. My task now is to come up with three different patterns that are more effective and specific based on the provided trace data.\n\nThe trace shows two executions of ExitProcess, each involving a call to some function (0040E7C3h) followed by another call. The key part here seems to be around the call to 0040E7C3h where there's an E8C8FFFFFF instruction before the actual call.\n\nIn Strategy A, which is the first strategy tried, we look at the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. The failure message suggests that this didn't work because it matched but didn't hit any new signatures. Maybe the pattern was too broad or located in the wrong place.\n\nStrategy B is about checking before the exit, which could be more effective if Strategy A failed. Looking at the trace, after the call to E8C8FFFFFF, there's a pop ecx and another push. The failure message mentioned an error with generating the rule, so perhaps this strategy needs a more specific pattern.\n\nStrategy C involves using techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection, which might be too obscure unless they're specifically applied here.\n\nNow, focusing on the trace data, I see several hex instructions:\n\n- 0040E7EE: mov edi, edi\n- 0040E7F0: push ebp\n- 0040E7F1: mov ebp, esp\n- 0040E7F3: push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nThen E8C8FFFFFF which is a call instruction.\n\nLooking at the call pattern, it's likely that the bypass needs to find where this call happens and then somehow skip it. The failure reason was about not generating the rule, so maybe the initial patterns were too broad or didn't account for the specific offset or conditional logic after the call.\n\nSo, I'll need to create three different 6-20 byte patterns that match these calls specifically. Each pattern should capture a unique part of the trace where the bypass can occur without matching other locations.\n\nFirst pattern: The initial push and mov operations followed by the call. Maybe capturing the push ebp, mov ebp, esp, then the call to E8C8FFFFFF.\n\nSecond pattern: After the call, there's another push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. This could be a unique sequence after the first bypass attempt.\n\nThird pattern: The final part of the trace where FF15ACB04100 is called. Maybe this is the exit decision point that needs to be targeted instead.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern uses exact hex values from the trace, with ?? for any varying addresses or offsets. This way, they only match in the intended location and not elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts focused on a too broad or less specific approach. By creating more targeted patterns based on the exact instructions in the trace, we can bypass the exit process effectively.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: The evolved patterns are designed to target specific sequences within the provided trace, ensuring they match only at the correct locations and avoid false positives.\n\n**REASONING**: Using precise hex values from the trace ensures that each pattern is unique to its intended location. This specificity increases the likelihood of bypassing without causing errors or matching other potential threats.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with specific exit process targets\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF15ACB04100 }\n\n    condition:\n        (call_test_je AND E8C8FFFFFF) OR (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]) OR (FF15ACB04100)\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. From what I understand, we're dealing with a sample that has two traces, both ending with calls to ExitProcess and then to some function 0041B0Ac.\n\nThe last attempt didn't generate a YARA rule because it failed, so now we need to learn from that failure and try new patterns. The key is to use the existing trace data exactly as given without inventing anything new.\n\nLooking at the traces, both have the same structure: they call a function (probably a check) and then call 0041B0Ac. The previous strategy tried to match the first 30% of the trace with a pattern involving a call test and JE/JNE, but it didn't work because maybe the rule was too broad or didn't hit at the right point.\n\nSince previous attempts used the wrong location (earlier in the trace), I should consider moving the bypass point further. Maybe after some conditional checks before the exit. The strategies mentioned earlier suggest looking for patterns just before the exit call, like checking if the decision is made there.\n\nI need to find three different 6-20 byte patterns that can be found in the traces and use them as bypass points. Let's look at the trace data:\n\nFor both traces:\n- There are calls to functions with certain hex values.\n- The first few instructions push ebp, mov edi, etc., then call a function (0040E7C3h) and finally call 0041B0ACh.\n\nPerhaps I can find patterns in these sequences. For example, looking for specific instruction sequences that occur just before the exit or after certain operations.\n\nOne approach is to look for calls followed by the ExitProcess call. Maybe a pattern like \"CALL ... then E8C8FFFFFF and FF7508\". Or perhaps something involving specific registers being set before the call.\n\nAnother idea is to find conditional jumps, but since the previous attempt didn't work, maybe I should avoid that unless necessary.\n\nI also need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Maybe one pattern looks for a specific instruction right after the push ebp, another after the mov ebp, esp, and another in between calls.\n\nLet me think about possible patterns:\n\n1. After the first push ebp (0040E7F0), maybe looking for a specific instruction sequence that leads to the next call.\n2. After the mov ebp, esp (0040E7F1), perhaps an instruction like FF7508 which pushes a dword ptr.\n3. In between calls, maybe the exact byte sequences that follow each call.\n\nI should make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards where necessary for varying offsets.\n\nWait, but I need to capture exactly what's in the trace. For example, after the first push, there's FF7508, then more pushes. Maybe a pattern that includes these exact hex values can help pinpoint where the bypass occurs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the call to 0041B0ACh as part of the bypass pattern might work better since it's unique in each trace.\n\nI should also consider the timing or specific register states before the exit. For example, if a certain register is set just before the exit, that could be a bypass point.\n\nBut I'm not sure about all these possibilities without more context. Maybe focusing on the exact sequences right before the ExitProcess call would be better.\n\nAlso, since the previous rule didn't generate, maybe it was too broad or matched multiple times incorrectly. So making each pattern specific enough to avoid false positives is key.\n\nI think creating three different patterns: one after push ebp, another after mov ebp, esp, and a third right before FF15ACB04100 call. Each would have unique instruction sequences from the trace.\n\nLet me draft these patterns now.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt used an incorrect location for bypassing, which failed to generate a rule. By analyzing the traces, we identified specific instruction sequences after key points (push ebp and mov ebp) that can be targeted without false positives. These new patterns are more precise and avoid matching unintended locations.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns target specific instructions following push operations, ensuring a precise bypass location while avoiding false matches found in previous attempts.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeted after key operations\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 FC }\n        $pattern1 = { 83F8 01 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 }\n}\n\ncondition:\n    (any of the patterns match)\n}\n\nYARA_RULE\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to improve the YARA bypass rule based on the feedback we got from Iteration 2. The current best rule isn't hitting any new signatures, which means it's probably not effective enough or maybe matching in the wrong place.\n\nLooking back at the trace data provided, there are two calls to ExitProcess at different offsets: 0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF. Both traces have similar structures with a call to some function (probably the exit handler) followed by a call to another address, like 0041B0ACh.\n\nIn our previous attempt, we tried using the first part of the trace where it called 0040E7C3h and then pushed some data. But since that didn't yield new signatures, maybe we need to adjust where or what we're checking.\n\nThe user mentioned three strategies: Evasion Check, Exit Decision, and Evasion Technique. Since the previous attempts failed with \"rule hit but no new signatures,\" it's likely because the bypass was too early or not specific enough.\n\nLet me think about Strategy A first. It looks for a call to TEST EAX followed by JE/JNE in the first 30% of the trace. Maybe our current pattern is too broad, capturing more than just the intended exit check. Perhaps we need to be more precise with where the bypass occurs.\n\nLooking at the traces, after the initial setup (pushing ebp and edi), there's a call to the handler function, then pushing some data. The first call is E8C8FFFFFF which seems like a placeholder for the actual instruction. Then it calls 0040E7C3h, pushes dword ptr [ebp+08h], and finally calls 0041B0ACh.\n\nIf we're using Strategy A, maybe our pattern starts too early. Instead of looking at the first part where it's setting up, perhaps we should focus on the section right before the exit call or after pushing the data but before the final call.\n\nStrategy B is about checking before the exit itself, so that might be a better target. If we can find a condition that must be met before the program exits, that could create a bypass point where the execution is deflected early enough to avoid detection.\n\nLooking at the traces again, right after the setup and pushing data, it calls 0041B0ACh. Maybe if we create a pattern around that call or just before it, we can bypass the exit earlier.\n\nAlso, Strategy C involves using specific techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection. But since our previous attempts didn't find new signatures, maybe those are not applicable here, and we should stick to checking calls.\n\nAnother thought: The current patterns in our previous rule might be matching too broadly across both traces because both have similar call sequences. Maybe by making the patterns more specific to each trace's offset, we can avoid false positives.\n\nSo perhaps creating two different bypass patterns\u2014one for each exit point (0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF)\u2014would help. Each pattern would target a specific section of the trace where the actual exit handler is called after some setup.\n\nWait, but in both traces, ExitProcess is called with similar structures: after setting up ebp and edi, it calls the handler function (0040E7C3h), then pushes something to the stack at [ebp+08h], and finally calls the target address. So maybe we can create a pattern that matches this exact sequence.\n\nAlternatively, since both traces have the same structure except for different exit addresses, perhaps focusing on the point right after pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h] before the final call could be our bypass point.\n\nSo combining all these thoughts, I think creating two patterns: one targeting the first ExitProcess (0040E7F6) and another targeting the second (0040E7FF). Each pattern would follow the same structure but with specific offsets where the data is pushed. This way, we avoid matching in wrong locations because each pattern corresponds to a specific trace.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the traces and previous attempts, here's an improved YARA bypass rule focusing on specific exit points:\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**\nThe initial approach used a too broad or less precise bypass, leading to no new signatures. By targeting specific exit points (0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF) with detailed patterns that match only these traces' structures, the rule becomes more accurate.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**\n- **Pattern A:** Targets ExitProcess at offset 0040E7F6\n- **Pattern B:** Targets ExitProcess at offset 0040E7FF\n\n**CAPE_OPTIONS:**\nInclude patterns for both exit points with their respective offsets, ensuring specificity to avoid false matches.\n\n**REASONING:**\nBy creating specific bypass patterns targeting each exit point after the setup and data push, we increase the rule's accuracy. Each pattern is designed to match only the intended traces' structures at these exact offsets.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting specific exit points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [0040E7F3:FF7508, 0040E7F6:E8C8FFFFFF, 0040E7F7:59, 0040E7F8:FF7508, 0040E7F9:E8C8FFFFFF] }\n        $pattern1 = { [0040E7FF:FF7508, 0040E7FB:E8C8FFFFFF, 0040E7FC:59, 0040E7FD:FF7508, 0040E7FE:E8C8FFFFFF] }\n\n    condition:\n        (any of the patterns match)\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to correct the Yara rule because the previous attempt failed validation. The main issue was that the generic pattern was too short\u2014only 5 bytes instead of the required minimum of 6. \n\nLooking at the original rules, each $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2 were only 8 bytes long, which is below the required 6-20 bytes. So I need to expand each pattern by adding more instructions or bytes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the trace data provided. The traces show that after certain instructions like E8C8FFFFFF (which is a call), there's another call. Maybe these can be used as context in the patterns.\n\nFor $pattern0, let me consider the first part of the trace: 8BFF, 55, 8BEC, FF7508, then E8C8FFFFFF, which pushes something to ebp+8h and calls a function. So maybe I can take this sequence and include some surrounding context.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1, perhaps another part of the trace with similar instructions but different values or patterns.\n\nI should ensure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes by combining multiple instructions. Also, any address or offset bytes need to be replaced with ?? as per wildcard rules. Op codes and register encodings must stay concrete.\n\nLet me try constructing each pattern:\n\n1. $pattern0 could start from E8C8FFFFFF (the first call) and include the next few instructions.\n2. $pattern1 might capture a different part of the trace, maybe after another instruction like 59 (pop ecx).\n3. $pattern2 can be constructed from another set in the trace.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and uses wildcards where necessary. Also, include enough context so that skipping these patterns would prevent the exit but not affect other parts of the code.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - adapted patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??
