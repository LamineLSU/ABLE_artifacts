      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to correct this Yara rule based on the given error messages and trace data. Let me start by understanding what's going wrong.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: there's a problem with the pattern starting at E8 having only 2 context bytes after it. The error message says that we need 4+ bytes to avoid triggering new signatures. So, each of our patterns needs enough context after them to make sure they're specific enough without being too short.\n\nThe original rule had three patterns: $pattern0, $pattern1, and $pattern2. But the error mentioned that pattern count is incorrect. It seems like I need exactly three patterns, but looking back at the trace data, there are three traces (TRACE #1, #2, #3), each with different instruction sequences.\n\nWait, in the original rule, $pattern0 was starting at E8 with only two bytes after. The error suggests that we need four more bytes to avoid triggering new signatures. So, maybe each pattern needs a longer context.\n\nLooking at the trace data:\n\nTRACE #1 has E825050000 as part of it (line 00866183). So $pattern0 could be around there with enough context.\n\nTRACE #2 and #3 have E8C8FFFFFF and FF15ACB04100, which are different from the first. But wait, in the original rule, they were using E8 starting points, but perhaps those don't have enough bytes after.\n\nI think I need to adjust each pattern to include more context bytes after the initial instruction. Also, ensure that each pattern is unique and covers a distinct part of the trace to avoid duplication.\n\nSo, for $pattern0, maybe take the E8 instruction from TRACE #1 with four following bytes as wildcards because those are address/offsets we don't know exact values. So it would look like E8 followed by five ?? (since each byte is two hex digits).\n\nFor $pattern1, perhaps another E8 in a different trace but ensuring it's a different instruction context. Maybe from TRACE #2 where there's an E8C8FFFFFF call.\n\nAnd for $pattern2, maybe from TRACE #3 with FF15ACB04100.\n\nBut I also need to make sure that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long. So combining two instructions might be enough if they fit within the 6-byte minimum.\n\nWait, in the example given, a pattern was something like 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? which is 12 bytes. That's acceptable because it includes the target instruction plus surrounding context.\n\nSo applying that to our case:\n\n$pattern0 could be E8 followed by five wildcards: E8????. But wait, each wildcard represents a single byte as ?? (two hex digits). So if I have E8 followed by four ??, that would make 5 bytes. Adding more instructions around it might help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combine two consecutive instructions to form the pattern. For example, E8 and then the next instruction's bytes with wildcards.\n\nWait, in the original rule, $pattern0 was { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }, which is five bytes: E8 followed by four ??. But that's only 5 bytes, so it might not be sufficient because each pattern needs to be at least 6 bytes. So I should add another instruction after that.\n\nLooking back at the traces:\n\nIn TRACE #1, after E825050000, there are more instructions like 8BCE, etc. Maybe $pattern0 could include E8 followed by four ?? and then some context from the next instruction.\n\nSimilarly for $pattern1 and $pattern2, I need to pick different points in each trace with enough following bytes as wildcards.\n\nAlso, using the wildcard principle: any address or offset must be replaced with ??, so for CALL instructions, their offsets should be marked as such.\n\nFor example, if a pattern includes a CALL instruction followed by an offset, that offset becomes ?? after the opcode. So in Yara patterns, after the opcode, the next four bytes are the offset (for 4-byte calls), which would become ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n$pattern0: E8 followed by four ??. Let's say E8 is at position X, then the next instruction is something like 83C4... So maybe combine them as E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? ?\n\nWait, but I need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the traces.\n\nAlternatively, let's take from TRACE #1: E825050000. The instruction after that is 8BCE, so maybe $pattern0 includes E8 followed by four ??. So:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nBut wait, that's only five bytes (E8 plus four ??), which might be too short. To meet the minimum of six bytes, perhaps add another instruction after.\n\nLooking at the next instruction: 8BCE is a mov instruction. So maybe include CE and then the next instruction's context as wildcards.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be E8 followed by CE and some wildcards:\n\nE8 CE ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nThat would make six bytes, which meets the requirement. Plus, it includes context after the CE instruction for specificity.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1 from TRACE #2: The call is at E8C8FFFFFF. Then the next instruction is 59 (pop), so maybe include that as well with wildcards:\n\nE8 C8 followed by five ?? to make six bytes? Wait, E8 C8 would be two instructions, each contributing two hex digits, but in Yara patterns, we can combine them into one pattern.\n\nWait, no. Each instruction is represented by its hex bytes, so combining multiple instructions might complicate the pattern length.\n\nAlternatively, take the E8C8FFFFFF call and include some surrounding context:\n\nE8 C8 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nThat's six bytes: E8, C8, four wildcards (since each ?? represents a single byte). Wait, no. Each instruction is represented by two hex digits for each byte. So if I have E8 as the first byte, that's one instruction. Then adding another instruction like 59 would make it longer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nEach pattern should be a sequence of bytes from consecutive instructions, with address/offsets replaced by ??, and each opcode and register-encoding kept concrete.\n\nSo for $pattern0 in TRACE #1:\n\nThe instruction is E8 25 05 00 00 (from E825050000). Then the next instruction is 8BCE. So perhaps include both E8 and CE with some wildcards after.\n\nBut wait, that would be too long for a single pattern if I include multiple instructions beyond E8. Alternatively, maybe take just the E8 instruction with four ?? to meet the six-byte requirement.\n\nWait, but in Yara patterns, each instruction is represented by its bytes. So an E8 instruction is one byte: 0xE8. Then any following offset would be two hex digits for a single byte. Wait no, offsets are typically represented as multiple bytes depending on size (1,2,4-byte). But in Yara patterns, to represent an address or displacement, we use ??.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each instruction that has address/offsets, replace them with ??.\n\nIn $pattern0: E8 followed by four wildcards would be five bytes. To make it six, maybe include another instruction's first byte as concrete.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, after E825050000 (E8), the next instruction is 8BCE (8B CE). So perhaps $pattern0 includes E8 followed by four ??: that would be five bytes. Then add one more concrete byte from the next instruction to reach six.\n\nSo:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B }\n\nBut wait, 8B is a single byte (0x8B), so adding it as another concrete byte after the four wildcards makes a total of six bytes: E8 followed by four ?? and then 8B.\n\nThat should be acceptable.\n\nSimilarly for $pattern1 from TRACE #2:\n\nThe call is at E8C8FFFFFF, which is one instruction. So maybe take that plus five more bytes as wildcards to make six bytes? Or include another instruction after it.\n\nWait, in the original rule, $pattern1 was {6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }, but that might be too long because each ? represents a single byte. Wait no, each ?? is two hex digits for one byte. So I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIn Yara patterns, each byte is represented by two hex digits. An address or displacement (like in a call) would replace the entire offset with ?? as many bytes as needed to represent it.\n\nSo if a call has an offset of 0x12345678, that's four bytes: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78. In Yara patterns, we replace each byte with ?? (so four ??: ?? ?? ?? ??).\n\nSo for $pattern0 in TRACE #1:\n\nE8 instruction is one byte: E8.\n\nThen the call at CE (from 8BCE) would be part of another instruction, but perhaps that's not necessary. Alternatively, take the E8 and then five wildcards to make six bytes: E8 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nWait, no. Each wildcard represents a single byte as two hex digits, so four wildcards are eight hex digits (four bytes). But in this case, we're only including one instruction (E8) plus four ?? which is five bytes total. To meet the minimum of six, maybe include another instruction's first byte.\n\nIn the next instruction after E825050000 is 8BCE, so perhaps:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 CE ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nBut that would be two instructions (E8 and CE) which are each represented by their bytes. So E8 is one byte, CE is another.\n\nWait, but in Yara patterns, when you have multiple consecutive instructions, they're all included as separate bytes. So combining E8 followed by CE with four wildcards would make it six bytes:\n\nE8 CE ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut wait, that's two concrete bytes and four wildcards (each representing one byte). Wait no: each ??? represents a single byte.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused between how Yara interprets the patterns. Each hexadecimal digit is part of a byte. So if you have E8 followed by CE, that's two bytes. Then adding four more bytes as ?? would make six total? No, wait:\n\nE8 (1 byte) + CE (1 byte) = 2 bytes.\n\nThen adding four ?? (each is one byte) makes it 6 bytes in total: 2 + 4 = 6. So the pattern would be E8 CE followed by four wildcards: E8 CE ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nWait, no. Each wildcard represents a single byte as ?? (two hex digits). So for each byte that's an address or offset, we use ??.\n\nSo if after CE there are more instructions with addresses, those would also be marked as ??.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to take the E8 instruction and include four wildcards beyond it, making five bytes. Then add another concrete byte from the next instruction. So:\n\nE8 (1 byte) + four ????: that's five bytes total. To make six, maybe add one more concrete byte: like CE.\n\nSo $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??: CE } → but wait, CE is a single byte. Hmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to take the E8 instruction and include four wildcards beyond it, then another instruction's first byte as concrete. For example:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B }\n\nThis would be six bytes: E8 followed by CE (but wait, that's two instructions). Wait no, I'm mixing up the trace lines.\n\nWait, in TRACE #1, after E825050000 is 8BCE. So perhaps:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??: 8B }\n\nThat would be E8 (1 byte) + four ?? (four bytes) and then the next instruction's first byte (8B). That totals six bytes.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for $pattern1 in TRACE #2:\n\nThe call is at E8C8FFFFFF. Then the next instruction is 59 (pop ebp). So perhaps include E8 followed by five ?? to make six bytes, then another concrete byte from the next instruction.\n\nSo $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??: 59 }\n\nThat would be six bytes: E8 plus five ????, and then 59 as the sixth byte.\n\nWait, no. Each wildcard represents a single byte. So E8 is one byte, followed by five wildcards (five bytes) makes six total. Then adding another instruction's first byte as concrete would exceed six. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take two instructions: E8 and C8 from E8C8FFFFFF, then four ????: making 6 bytes? Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, in the original rule, $pattern1 was {6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }, which is longer than six bytes. So perhaps I should combine two or three instructions into each pattern to meet the length requirement.\n\nBut this might complicate things because we need exactly three patterns with at least six bytes each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for $pattern1, take a different instruction from each trace that allows us to create unique patterns.\n\nLooking back, in TRACE #3, there's an E8C8FFFFFF call followed by FF15ACB04100. So perhaps:\n\n$pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? CE }\n\nThat would be six bytes: E8 plus five ????, but wait that's only six if the next instruction is included as part of the pattern.\n\nWait, no. Each instruction in Yara is a byte or multiple bytes for opcodes and operands. So perhaps:\n\nTake E8 (1) + C8 (2) + ?? four times (3-6), making it six bytes: E8 C8 ???? ????\n\nThat would be 4 instructions: E8, C8, followed by four wildcards.\n\nWait, that's only three bytes beyond the first two. So total of five bytes. Need to make sure each pattern is at least six.\n\nAlternatively, take E8C8FFFFFF as one instruction (that's a multi-byte opcode, but in Yara it would be represented as individual bytes), so perhaps:\n\nE8 C8 followed by four ????: that's 6 bytes. Or maybe more if necessary.\n\nI'm getting stuck on the exact byte count and how to structure each pattern correctly.\n\nLet me try another approach: look at the example patterns provided in the validation errors.\n\nIn the GOOD EXAMPLE, there's `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` which is 12 bytes. So each instruction can contribute multiple bytes to the pattern.\n\nSo for our case:\n\n$pattern0 could be E8 followed by four ????: five bytes. Then add another instruction's first byte as concrete, making it six: E8 CE ????.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because CE is part of a different instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take the E8 from TRACE #1 and include the next three instructions' relevant bytes with wildcards to meet the length.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 25 05 00 00 ?? }\n\nBut that's only five bytes. Adding another concrete byte: E8 25 05 00 00 CE would be six bytes. But is CE part of the same call?\n\nHmm, I think this is getting too complicated without a clear example.\n\nLet me instead focus on creating three unique patterns from each trace:\n\n1. $pattern0: From TRACE #1, E8 instruction followed by four wildcards and then another concrete byte (CE).\n2. $pattern1: From TRACE #2, E8C8FFFFFF call plus some wildcards.\n3. $pattern2: From TRACE #3, FF15ACB04100.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each pattern is six bytes or longer.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 25 05 00 00 CE } → six bytes\n$pattern1 = { E8 C8 FFFF 00 00 00 } → Not sure about this.\n$pattern2 = { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 } → five bytes, need to add one more concrete byte.\n\nBut I'm not confident in this approach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to look for unique instruction sequences in each trace that can form six-byte patterns with wildcards.\n\nWait, another idea: Each pattern should capture a distinct path through the traces. So $pattern0 could be from TRACE #1's E8 call, $pattern1 from #2, and $pattern2 from #3, ensuring they are unique.\n\nSo:\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 CE ?? ?? ?? ?? } → six bytes\n$pattern1 = { E8 C8 FFFF ?? ?? ?? } → but not sure about the exact bytes.\nWait, no. Each instruction is represented by its bytes in Yara patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the following approach:\n\n- For $pattern0: Take E8 from TRACE #1 and include four wildcards beyond it to make six bytes. So {E8?? ?? ?? ??: 8B} → but not sure.\n  \nWait, maybe another way is needed. I think I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try to outline each pattern step by step:\n\n1. Identify three distinct instruction sequences from the three traces that are specific enough (each with at least four bytes beyond the main instruction).\n\n2. Ensure each sequence includes address/offsets replaced with wildcards.\n\n3. Each pattern should be six bytes or longer.\n\n4. The patterns must not repeat and cover different points in each trace.\n\nSo, for $pattern0 from TRACE #1:\n\nFind a point where we can capture E8 followed by four ?? to make at least six bytes. Then add another instruction's first byte as concrete.\n\nFor example: E8 CE followed by four ????: but that would be two instructions (E8 and CE) plus four wildcards, which is seven bytes. That exceeds the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, take E8 followed by five ????: six bytes.\n\n$pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nBut then we need to add another instruction's first byte as concrete. So: E8 CE ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nWait, no, that would be two instructions (E8 and CE) plus four wildcards: total of seven bytes, which is acceptable.\n\nSimilarly for $pattern1 from TRACE #2:\n\nTake E8C8 followed by four ????: but I'm not sure if C8 is part of the same instruction. Alternatively, take E8C8FFFF as one instruction (which might be a 4-byte call) and then add some wildcards beyond it.\n\n$pattern1 = {E8C8 ????} → five bytes. Add another concrete byte: E8C8 FFFF ?? ??: but that's six.\n\nFinally, $pattern2 from TRACE #3:\n\nTake FF15ACB04100 and include the next instruction as part of the pattern. For example, if after that there's 008D..., so take FF15ACB04100 followed by ??.\n\nBut let me count bytes: FF is one byte, 15 another, AC, B0, 41, 00 (five more), total of six. So $pattern2 = {FF 15 AC B0 41 00} → five bytes. Add another concrete byte from the next instruction.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nI think it's time to try writing out each pattern with these considerations in mind, making sure each is at least six bytes and captures a unique path.\n</think>\n\nTo address the validation errors, we need to correct the Yara rule by ensuring exactly three patterns are present, each meeting the 6-20 byte requirement. Each pattern must capture specific instruction sequences from different traces with wildcards for addresses/offsets.\n\nHere's the corrected YARA rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection rules\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 CE ?? ?? ?? ?? }  // From TRACE #1: E8 followed by CE and four wildcards\n        $pattern1 = { E8 C8 FFFF ?? ?? ?? } // From TRACE #2: E8C8FFFF with four wildcards\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }   // From TRACE #3: Direct instruction sequence\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **$pattern0**: Captures the E8 instruction followed by CE, with four wildcards to ensure specificity.\n- **$pattern1**: Represents a unique call from another trace with sufficient context.\n- **$pattern2**: A distinct instruction sequence ensuring it's not duplicated and meets length requirements.\n\nEach pattern is crafted to be specific enough while remaining general enough for Yara to detect them.",

Let me break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the rule has only one pattern instead of three required. So I'll need to create exactly three different patterns. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offsets and keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I can identify several suspicious points where an instruction might have been bypassed. For each of these, I'll create a separate pattern.\n\nPattern 1: The first call to E825050000 suggests a potential early exit. I'll include this and some surrounding instructions to make the pattern specific. So I'll take E8, then the next four bytes as wildcards (??), followed by other relevant bytes like 0F84.\n\nPattern 2: There's another call at E8C8FFFFFF which could be a bypass point. This time, including the context after the call might help. Maybe include the following instructions like 59 and FF7508 as wildcards to avoid exact matches elsewhere.\n\nPattern 3: A third call in the trace is at FF15ACB04100. Combining this with surrounding bytes, I can create a distinct pattern here too. Using wildcards around the displacement after the call should cover it without being specific enough for other uses.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern has exactly six to twenty bytes and includes the necessary wildcards where applicable. Each pattern will be placed in the strings section under their respective $pattern variables.\n\nAdding the cape_options is crucial, so I'll include \"bp0=...\" etc., referencing each pattern correctly.\n\nFinally, I'll structure everything according to Yara's format, making sure there are exactly three patterns and they're all different. This should address the validation errors mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection for early exits\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F C4 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF C8 ???? 00 59 ?? ???? ???? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 ACB0 ?? ??? 83 CC ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
