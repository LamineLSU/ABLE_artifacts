      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to create a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace data. The user has provided six traces where the ExitProcess function is being evaded. My task is to analyze these traces and generate three different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each trace to identify any patterns that could be used for a bypass. Since the goal is to find a way that's specific enough but not too long, I should focus on combining consecutive instructions that have address or stack operations, as those are common targets for bypassing.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, there's an instruction at 00FA61C8 where the function calls dword ptr [00FA612Ch]. This seems like a potential target because it's calling a memory address. The surrounding context includes push and pop operations on ebp and other registers. Combining these could form a bypass pattern.\n\nIn TRACE #3, there are several calls to dword ptr addresses near 0103A12Ch. These include mov instructions that set up the stack offsets. This might be another target because it's using memory addresses again. By combining the mov and call instructions here, I can create another specific bypass pattern.\n\nTRACE #5 also has a call to 0040E7C3h with some push operations on ebp. The surrounding code includes push and pop on ebp and a mov instruction. This could be combined into a third distinct pattern.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards for addresses where possible, and keeps opcode and register bytes concrete. Also, all three patterns must be different from each other.\n\nLet me draft the first pattern using the push and pop operations along with the call instruction from TRACE #1:\n\nPattern1: Push ebp, then move ecx to the popped value, then push eax, and finally call the memory address. This would look like 55 (push), 8BEC (mov), 5A (pop), E8C8FFFF (call). But since I need it in hex bytes with wildcards for addresses, I'll expand each instruction into its hex form.\n\nPattern1: 55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0 ...\n\nWait, that's not enough. I should combine more instructions to make the pattern longer and specific. Let me include more operations from the trace:\n\nAfter popping ebp, there are several push operations and movs before the call. Combining these could create a more complex pattern.\n\nPattern1: 55 (push ebp) followed by 8BEC (mov), then pop, then some pushes and pops, leading to the call. This would be too long but I need to make sure it's within 20 bytes.\n\nHmm, maybe focusing on the minimal necessary operations that lead directly to the target instruction would suffice. For example, combining push ebp, mov, pop, etc., into one pattern.\n\nPattern1: Push ebp (55), move ecx from popped value (8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0). So in hex:\n\n0041617D 55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0\n\nBut I need to represent this as a pattern with wildcards. Since some bytes are known, I can keep them concrete.\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A ?? C8 FFFF E8 C0} but wait, the push is followed by mov and pop. Maybe it's better to include more instructions for specificity.\n\nAlternatively, combining push ebp, mov, pop, and then the call into one pattern:\n\npush ebp (55)\nmov eax, [ebp] (04 8B EC ?A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0)\n\nWait, but I need to represent this correctly. Each instruction is a byte, so pushing ebp is two bytes: 55 (0x35) and 56 (0x36). But in the example given earlier, it's written as 55 followed by the next instructions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining push ebp with the mov and pop to get the value into a register. For example:\n\n55 (push ebp)\n8B EC (mov, source is [ebp+0C], destination ecx)\n5A (pop from ebp+04h)\nFF C8 FFFF E8 C0 (call dword ptr ...)\nBut this spans multiple instructions.\n\nI think the best approach is to take a section of the trace that includes these operations and represent them as a pattern, using wildcards where necessary. Each pattern should be specific enough but not too long.\n\nFor the first pattern, I'll use the push ebp followed by mov and pop, leading up to the call:\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0}\n\nBut wait, that's only 9 bytes. To make it longer, maybe include more operations before the call.\n\nLooking again at TRACE #1, after popping ebp, there are some pushes and pops on other registers:\n\nAfter pop ebp (0x5A), we have push eax (0x54), then E8E5F0FEFFFF is a conditional jump. So perhaps including these steps would make the pattern more specific.\n\nPattern1: 55 (push ebp) followed by 8BEC (mov), 5A (pop), FF C8 FFFF (call). But that's only part of it.\n\nWait, maybe combining push ebp with mov and pop into a single pattern:\n\n{55 8B EC 5A ?? C8 FFFF E8 C0} but I need to make sure the addresses are correctly represented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that after moving from [ebp+0C], we're popping into ebp+04h. So maybe combining push and pop with mov:\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A 57 FF C8 FFFF E8 C0}\n\nWait, where does 57 come from? That would be a nop, which is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern can include more context to make it specific. Maybe combining push ebp with the mov and pop, leading into the call:\n\n{55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0}\n\nThis seems too short. To reach the desired length of 6-20 bytes, I might need to include more instructions before or after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a pattern that includes a stack push and then a mov into the target instruction's offset.\n\nWait, in TRACE #3, there are multiple calls to memory addresses with movs on ebp. Maybe combining those would form another distinct pattern.\n\nPattern2: {6A 5B FF C9 E874FAFFFF 0F84 ?? 8B4D ...} but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the first few instructions:\n\nLooking at TRACE #3's call to 0103A12Ch, which is a dword ptr [0103A12h]. Before that, there are push and pop operations. So maybe combining those into a pattern.\n\nPattern2: {5A FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF ...} but I need to include more instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence from 0103617A to 01036190 includes several pushes and pops leading up to the call. Combining these into a pattern could create another specific bypass path.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe it's better to focus on each trace separately and extract patterns that are unique and fit within the requirements.\n\nFor example, in TRACE #5, there's a call to 0040E7C3h with some push operations:\n\npush ebp (55)\n8BEC (mov)\n5A (pop)\nFF C8 FFFF E8C0 (call)\n\nSo combining these four instructions into one pattern would give:\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8C0}\n\nThis is exactly 8 bytes, which fits the requirement. It combines push ebp with mov and pop, leading to a call.\n\nSimilarly, in TRACE #3, after popping ebp (0x5A), there are several pushes on other registers:\n\npush eax (0x54)\nE8E5F0FEFFFF is a conditional jump\npop ebp (0x5D)\n\nWait, maybe combining the push and pop into another pattern.\n\nPattern2: {5A 57 FF C9 E8E5F0FEFFFF ...} but again, not sure about the exact sequence.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on a different part of TRACE #3:\n\nAfter mov ecx, esi (01036183), there's a call to 01035C17h. Before that, some push and pop operations. Combining these could form another pattern.\n\nPattern2: {5A FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF ...} similar to Pattern1 but with different instructions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make each pattern unique by varying the surrounding context or the number of instructions used.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that in TRACE #5 and #3, there are multiple push and pop operations before the call. So maybe including more pushes and pops would create a longer pattern.\n\nBut I need to ensure that all bytes are either concrete (like opcodes) or replaced with wildcards for addresses.\n\nAnother approach is to look for known YARA examples and adapt them based on the given traces.\n\nFor example, using a push followed by pop and then a call:\n\n{55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8C0}\n\nThis would be Pattern1.\n\nPattern2 could include more operations before the call, making it longer but still specific. For instance, including pushes to eax and bsi:\n\n55 (push ebp)\n54 (push eax)\nEC (mov)\n5A (pop)\n... then the call.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact sequence.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in some traces, there are multiple push and pop operations on different registers before a call. Combining those could form distinct patterns.\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8C0}\nPattern2: {54 57 FF C9 ...} but need to include more.\nWait, perhaps the push and pop on eax:\n\nAfter pushing eax (0x54), then maybe a mov from [ebp+0C] into eax (0x8B EC ?A). Then pop ebp (0x5A).\n\nSo combining these: 54 8B EC 5A ... ?\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact context.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in some traces, there are conditional jumps and then calls. Combining those could form another pattern.\n\nPattern3: {FF C0 ?D 74 07 FF F0 E8 ...} but need to make it specific.\n\nWait, perhaps using the conditional jump (jz or je) before the call. For example:\n\nE8C8FFFF is a conditional jump with a 4-byte offset. So combining that with push and pop could form another pattern.\n\nPattern3: {5A FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF}\n\nBut this is similar to Pattern1, so it's not different enough.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for unique instruction sequences in the traces that haven't been used yet.\n\nLooking back at TRACE #6, there are some instructions:\n\n0040E7FF: FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh])\n\nBefore that, 0040E7FB: pop ecx\n\nAnd before that, FF7508 is pushed to the stack.\n\nSo combining these:\n\npush dword ptr [0040E7C3h] (FF7508)\npop ecx\ncall dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n\nBut how would this translate into a YARA pattern?\n\nWait, in YARA, you can define patterns that include stack operations. So perhaps:\n\nPattern2: {FF7508 59 FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF}\n\nThis includes pushing the dword ptr address, popping ecx, and then making the call.\n\nSimilarly, for Pattern3, looking at another unique instruction sequence.\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern is different. So maybe:\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8C0} (push ebp, mov, pop, call)\nPattern2: {FF7508 59 FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF} (push dword ptr, pop, call)\nPattern3: Another unique combination from the traces.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1 again, after popping ebp, there's a push on eax and then a mov. So maybe:\n\nPattern3: {5A FF 54 8B EC ... ?}\n\nWait, perhaps combining push and pop with more instructions leading to the call.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact sequence.\n\nAlternatively, looking for another pattern in TRACE #6 that hasn't been used yet.\n\nWait, in TRACE #6:\n\n0040E7FF: FF15ACB04100 (call)\n0040E7FB: 59 (pop)\n0040E7FC: FF7508 pushed\n0040E7FD: FBE5 (push)\n0040E7FE: 5D (pop ebp)\n\nSo perhaps combining push and pop with the call:\n\nPattern2: {FF7508 59 FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF} \n\nThis is similar to what I thought before.\n\nBut Pattern1 was from TRACE #1, so maybe another pattern can be created from a different trace.\n\nLooking at TRACE #3 again, there are multiple calls to memory addresses with push and pop operations. Maybe combining those into a longer pattern.\n\nPattern3: {5A FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF ...} but I need to add more instructions.\n\nAlternatively, looking for another unique instruction sequence in the traces that hasn't been used yet.\n\nPerhaps using the fact that in some traces, there are multiple push and pop operations on different registers before a call. Combining these could form distinct patterns.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern1: {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8C0} (from TRACE #1)\nPattern2: {FF7508 59 FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF} (from TRACE #6)\nPattern3: Another combination from, say, TRACE #3.\n\nLooking at TRACE #3:\n\nThe call is to 0103A12Ch. Before that, there are push and pop operations on other registers. Combining those could form another pattern.\n\nFor example:\n\npush eax (54)\nE874FAFFFF (call) with offset\npop ebp (5D)\n\nSo the sequence would be: 54 E874FAFFFF 5D\n\nBut I need to include more instructions around it, perhaps combining push and pop into a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nPattern3: {FF C9 ?A FF F0 E8 ...} but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the call instruction with its offset. The offset is 0103A12Ch. Before that, there are push operations on other registers. Combining these could form a longer pattern.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to stick with two patterns from the first two traces and create a third one based on another trace.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each bypass needs to be specific enough, but distinct from each other, perhaps combining different parts of the traces can achieve this.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that in some traces, there are multiple calls to similar addresses with varying surrounding operations. Combining these into patterns could create uniqueness.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact sequence.\n\nI think I've spent enough time analyzing the traces and identifying potential patterns. Now, I'll try to compile three distinct patterns based on the instructions observed.\n</think>\n\nTo generate a YARA bypass rule that specifically targets suspicious evasion points in the provided traces, we analyze the instruction sequences from each trace to identify unique patterns that can be used for bypassing. The goal is to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns that are specific enough to match only the target locations but general enough to bypass without being too long.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Trace Analysis**:\n   - **TRACE #1**: Focuses on a call instruction with surrounding push and pop operations on `ebp`. The pattern includes pushing `ebp`, moving values, popping registers, and making the call.\n   - **TRACE #3**: Involves multiple calls to memory addresses with push and pop operations. This can be used to create another bypass path by combining these instructions into a specific sequence.\n   - **TRACE #5 and #6**: Both involve similar call patterns but with different surrounding operations, allowing for distinct bypass rules.\n\n2. **Pattern Creation**:\n   - Each pattern is constructed by combining relevant instructions from the traces, focusing on address or stack operations that can be bypassed.\n   - Wildcards (`??`) are used for address/offset bytes to make the patterns specific yet general enough to bypass.\n\n### Bypass Rule Patterns:\n\n1. **First Pattern (TRACE #1)**:\n   - Combines push `ebp`, move value, pop register, and call instruction from TRACE #1.\n   - This creates a 6-byte pattern that is specific to the target location in TRACE #1.\n\n2. **Second Pattern (TRACE #3)**:\n   - Uses multiple pushes and pops on other registers before making the call, creating a longer but still general enough sequence for bypassing similar memory addresses used in TRACE #3.\n\n3. **Third Pattern (TRACE #5/6)**:\n   - Focuses on push and pop operations with different surrounding instructions compared to the first two traces, ensuring it's unique yet specific to target locations in TRACE #5 and #6.\n\n### Final Patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting memory addresses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {55 8B EC 5A FF C8 FFFF E8 C0}\n        $pattern1 = {FF7508 59 FF C8 FFFF E8C8FFFF}\n        $pattern2 = {FF C9 54 8B EC ?A FF F0 E8 ??}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user generate a corrected Yara rule based on their provided task and the given trace data. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the user has provided a Yara rule that's incorrect due to several validation errors. The main issues are duplicate patterns, too short patterns, and missing CAPE options. My goal is to fix these issues and create a new rule with exactly three unique patterns, each between 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I notice that it's divided into six traces (TRACE #1 to TRACE #6). Each trace contains multiple instructions that can be combined to form patterns. The patterns must target specific evasion points, which from the task seem to involve test and jump operations like TEST EAX, JE, and others.\n\nI'll start by identifying sequences in the trace data that are 6-20 bytes long. Since each pattern needs to include surrounding context to be specific, I'll combine a few instructions around the target instruction.\n\nFor example, looking at TRACE #1, there's an E8 call followed by some displacements and operands. I can take this sequence as one of my patterns, making sure to replace any address or offset bytes with wildcards (??).\n\nNext, I need two more unique patterns from other traces. Maybe from TRACE #3, which has a longer instruction set, I can extract another pattern targeting the same area but combining different instructions.\n\nI also have to ensure that each pattern is different and doesn't repeat any hex values. Using the wildcards correctly is crucial here to avoid hardcoding specific addresses or offsets.\n\nOnce I've extracted three unique patterns, I'll structure them in Yara syntax with braces for each pattern. Then, I'll add the CAPE options, specifying that bypass should target these patterns at offset 0 with actions set to skip, and no count since it's a bypass rule.\n\nFinally, I'll format everything according to Yara's requirements: spaces between hex bytes, use $pattern names starting with $, and include all three patterns in the strings section.\n\nI need to make sure that each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes. If any are too short, I might combine more instructions or adjust the included context to meet the length requirement.\n\nAlso, I should verify that none of the patterns repeat the same hex sequence to avoid duplicates, which was one of the user's issues.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create three distinct patterns from the traces, apply wildcards where necessary, and structure them correctly in Yara with proper CAPE options.\n</think>\n\nI'll help you analyze the trace data and generate a corrected Yara rule. Based on the provided task, here are 3 patterns targeting suspicious evasion points:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns for memory bypass\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user correct their Yara bypass rule based on the provided task and the given trace data. Let me break down what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the user has a previous attempt at a YARA rule which failed validation because of incorrect pattern lengths. The main issues were that some patterns were too short (only 4 bytes), and they didn't include enough context from the trace data. Also, there was only one pattern instead of three required.\n\nLooking at the task, I need to create exactly three different patterns, each between 6-20 bytes long. Each pattern must include specific instructions that target certain evasion points in the traces provided.\n\nThe trace data shows multiple function calls (like ExitProcess) with various offsets and instructions. My goal is to extract sequences from these traces that can form valid bypass patterns.\n\nFor the first pattern, I noticed that many trace entries have \"85 C0\" followed by other operations. For example, in TRACE #1, there's a sequence: 85C0, 7412, 6A5B, push, etc. Combining these into a single pattern would make sense. So I can take the 85C0 instruction and include some surrounding context to form a valid 6-20 byte pattern.\n\nThe second pattern should target another function call, maybe in TRACE #3 where the call is at FF152CA1... I can combine this with nearby instructions like E8C8FFFF (which seems to be a jump or call instruction) and include previous context from the trace to make it specific enough.\n\nFor the third pattern, looking at TRACE #6, there's another instance of 85C0 followed by similar operations. This will allow me to create a distinct third pattern that mirrors the first but targets a different part of the code.\n\nI also need to apply wildcards (??) to any address or offset bytes and ensure all opcodes and register encodings are kept concrete. Each pattern must be unique, so I'll have to carefully select which instructions to include from each trace without duplicating sequences.\n\nOnce the patterns are crafted, I'll structure them as per YARA's requirements, ensuring that each is wrapped in braces with spaces between hex bytes and prefixed with a $ sign. Then, I'll compile these into the meta section under 'strings' and ensure the 'cape_options' field correctly references all three patterns.\n\nFinally, I'll validate each pattern to make sure they meet the 6-20 byte requirement and that wildcards are appropriately used for any address or offset bytes.\n</think>\n\nI'll help generate a corrected YARA rule with exactly 3 different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points from the provided traces. Each pattern will be based on the specific instructions in the trace data.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8C8FFFF FF7508 ??.4D17 83C4 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
