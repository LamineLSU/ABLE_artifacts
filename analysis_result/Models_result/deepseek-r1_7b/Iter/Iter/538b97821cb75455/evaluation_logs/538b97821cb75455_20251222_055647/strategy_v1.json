Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user by evolving a YARA rule based on their provided trace data and previous attempts. The goal is to bypass the malware evasion they're encountering.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data: both traces involve an ExitProcess call with some setup before it. Strategy A involves checking the first 30% of the trace for a CALL followed by TEST EAX or JE/JNE. But since their previous attempts didn't hit any new signatures, maybe the initial check isn't sufficient.\n\nI notice that after the call to TEST EAX, there's an E8C8FFFFFF instruction before the ExitProcess. This might indicate a timing vulnerability where the processor leaks information about the stack or memory access through instruction timings. Using RDTSC (Register Data Transfer Signature) can capture these timings because they take a fixed amount of time based on CPU architecture.\n\nSo, I'll create three patterns focusing on different aspects:\n\n1. **Pattern 0**: Look for TEST EAX followed by an RDTSC and then the ExitProcess call. This checks if there's any leakage before exiting.\n2. **Pattern 1**: Check for conditional jumps like JB or JL that bypass some sections of code, which might be used to hide the actual exit point.\n3. **Pattern 2**: Use specific instruction sequences like TEST EAX followed by a comparison and a jump, ensuring we target unique byte sequences found in the trace.\n\nEach pattern is crafted using exact hex values from the trace where possible, with wildcards for varying offsets or addresses. This specificity helps avoid false positives but also makes them more likely to match the correct location without unnecessary issues.\n\nI'll structure each YARA rule conditionally: if any of these patterns are found before the exit process, it indicates a bypass and should be skipped.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe previous attempts didn't find new signatures, suggesting that the initial bypass checks (Strategy A) were either too broad or not specific enough. By focusing on timing-based vulnerabilities and conditional jumps in Strategy B, we can more effectively target potential bypass points.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: RDTSC Timing Check\n\n**REASONING**: \n- **Pattern 0**: Look for a TEST EAX instruction followed by an RDTSC (Register Data Transfer Signature) to capture processor leaks before the exit. This helps identify if there's any timing-based leakage that could be exploited.\n- **Pattern 1**: Check for conditional jumps like JB or JL that skip over potential analysis points, making it harder to detect bypass mechanisms.\n- **Pattern 2**: Target specific instruction sequences (e.g., TEST EAX followed by a comparison and jump) known to be used in bypass strategies.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with timing checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??
