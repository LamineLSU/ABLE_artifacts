Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by evolving a YARA bypass rule based on their sample and failed attempts. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace data provided, there are three traces where ExitProcess is called. Each trace has specific instructions that might be useful for creating patterns. The goal is to find effective bypass strategies using these traces.\n\nThe user mentioned that previous attempts resulted in \"Rule hit but no new signatures,\" which suggests that their existing patterns matched but were in the wrong locations or didn't effectively bypass. So, I should focus on more specific and accurate patterns based on the actual trace data.\n\nLooking at Strategy A (Evasion Check), it involves checking early in the trace for a call to TEST EAX followed by a JE/JNE. In the traces provided, after the initial setup, there's always an `cmp eax, 01h` instruction with a je/jne following if al is not equal to 01h. This seems like a reliable pattern.\n\nFor Strategy B (Exit Decision), it looks for conditional checks before exiting. The first trace has a call to a function at 75924100h, which might be the exit point. However, since the exit was successfully called, this might not be a good bypass target as it would just halt execution again.\n\nStrategy C involves unique techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection, but without specific evidence from the traces, these are less likely to work.\n\nConsidering the patterns in the trace:\n\n1. The first few instructions after setup always have `cmp eax, 01h` followed by a conditional jump. This is a solid candidate for an evasion check.\n2. Another pattern could be the initial mov and shr operations before the test. For example, `64A130000000` is a specific offset that might point to the actual decision logic.\n3. The call at 75924100h seems to be an exit check, which could be another bypass target if it's reliable.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different sections of the trace to avoid overlaps or mismatches. Also, using exact hex values where possible will help match only the intended locations.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe previous attempts didn't generate new signatures, suggesting that the patterns matched in unintended locations or weren't specific enough. The traces show consistent patterns at specific offsets after the setup code, which can be exploited to create more reliable bypass rules.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE (Strategy A)\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: The traces consistently have a `TEST EAX` followed by a conditional jump. This is a reliable target for an evasion check as it's executed early and can be bypassed with minimal impact.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved using consistent patterns in the trace\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B4068       mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h] }\n        $pattern1 = { C1E808       shr eax, 08h               }\n        $pattern2 = { 7510           jne 0078655Ah           }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
