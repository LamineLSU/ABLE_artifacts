(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help create a Yara rule based on the provided trace and analyze it using the adversarial strategy. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user has given a detailed trace of instructions executed by some code. They want an evasion bypass rule that can be used to detect when this code is running without being detected, probably in a sandbox or debugger. The analysis involves three phases: the attacker's perspective (where they put their checks), the defender's perspective (how to bypass them), and then selecting specific points where the bypass can happen.\n\nFirst, I'll need to analyze each phase step by step. \n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe attacker likely implemented some checks to detect analysis tools or sandboxes. They might have checked for known signatures like sandbox entry points or debug commands. The goal is to see which instructions in the trace are their evasion mechanisms.\n\nLooking at the trace, I notice a lot of `8B 45` (mov eax, dword ptr [esi]) and some jumps with specific offsets. There's also multiple `TEST EAX` and `JZ` checks towards the end. This suggests that maybe they are checking if EAX is zero before executing certain code to bypass analysis.\n\nSo possible attacker's checks could be:\n1. Check for specific jump instructions (like EAX or JZX) with certain conditions.\n2. Use TEST EAX followed by JZ to skip code when EAX is not zero.\n3. Maybe some displacement jumps that require checking the value in EAX.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nNow, as a defender, I need to find where these checks can be bypassed or manipulated. The idea is to identify instructions that can be skipped without triggering these checks.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- If the attacker uses `TEST EAX`, then `JZ` when EAX isn't zero, perhaps they're trying to execute code only if EAX is non-zero.\n- They might have jumps with offsets that require EAX's value. For example, a jump with an offset dependent on EAX.\n\nPotential bypass points:\n1. Skipping the `TEST EAX` instruction itself could allow execution beyond without this check.\n2. Using a conditional jump (like JZX) where the condition is something other than EAX being zero might bypass their checks.\n3. Perhaps skipping certain displacement jumps by using wildcards or different instructions.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nI need to evaluate how easy it would be for an attacker to detect these bypasses and whether they are specific enough. Each bypass should ideally not only work against this specific evasion but also be robust against other legitimate uses.\n\nFor example:\n- Bypassing a `JZX` with a fixed offset might still trigger if the attacker's code sets EAX, making it less effective.\n- Using a different instruction sequence for the same check (like using BL instead of TEST) might bypass this particular defense but could introduce new issues.\n\n**Selecting Bypass Patterns**\n\nI need to choose three distinct patterns from the trace. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long and include surrounding context with wildcards where applicable.\n\nLooking at the trace, I can find several places where `TEST EAX` is followed by a jump or conditional move:\n\n1. The first occurrence of `TEST EAX` at instruction 4 (0x4) might have a JZX after it.\n2. Further down, there's another TEST EAX around instruction 18.\n\nPossible patterns:\n- Pattern 1: Includes the `TEST EAX`, then skipping to an instruction that bypasses the next check.\n- Pattern 2: Bypassing a specific displacement jump by using a different offset or instruction.\n- Pattern 3: Skipping some JZX instructions by using conditional jumps with different conditions.\n\nEach pattern needs to be constructed carefully, ensuring all address/offset bytes are replaced with `??`, and opcodes remain concrete.\n\nNow, I'll draft each pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern for the first TEST EAX bypass:**\n   - Instructions around instruction 4 (TEST EAX) followed by a conditional jump that doesn't check EAX.\n2. **Pattern to bypass a displacement jump using a different offset:**\n   - Instead of the fixed offset, use wildcard(s).\n3. **Pattern involving multiple consecutive instructions where a JZX is skipped with another condition:**\n   - Maybe using BL instead of TEST followed by a conditional that doesn't check EAX.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern covers enough context bytes after jumps or calls to avoid creating new signatures.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these into Yara patterns and include the correct `cape_options` as per the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting sandbox detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out how to create a Yara rule based on the given trace and instructions. Let me start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided trace, it seems like there are several function calls and conditional jumps. My goal is to identify the exit path so that I can find potential bypass points.\n\nI notice that towards the end of the trace, there's a call to E8 with some offset bytes (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??). That might be part of the exit point. Then, after calling that function, it does another call to 0F 84, which is a common way to bypass because it's a trap instruction.\n\nSo, maybe the exit path goes through these two calls: E8 with some offset and then 0F 84. \n\nNext, I need to find three different bypass patterns from these two instructions. Each pattern should combine several consecutive instructions into a hex sequence where address/offset bytes are replaced with ??.\n\nFor the first pattern, starting at E8, I can include the next four instruction bytes (?? ?? ?? ??). So the pattern would be E8 followed by those offsets: {E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}.\n\nThe second pattern starts right after the first one. Since it's a conditional jump near (0F 84), but to bypass, we usually just call 0F 84 without any offset or other bytes that might cause detection. So maybe I can take 74 or 75 followed by ??.\n\nLooking at the trace, there are two instances of 74 ??: one is 74 ?? and another is 75 ??, but they're on different lines. Wait, actually, in the given data, it's listed as:\n\n```\n74 ?? \n75 ??\n```\n\nSo I can create a pattern starting with 74 followed by four unknowns: {74 ?? ?? ??}.\n\nThe third pattern could be after that, maybe the next conditional jump. Looking at the trace again, there are lines like 0F 84 and then another 0F 85. To bypass, we can use either of these with or without an offset. Since 0F is a trap instruction, using it directly might not require any offset.\n\nSo perhaps taking 0F followed by ?? in the next byte: {0F ??}.\n\nWait, but I need each pattern to be 6-20 bytes long. So maybe for each of these, I can include more surrounding instructions to make the patterns longer and more specific.\n\nFor the first pattern starting at E8:\n\nE8 is followed by some addresses (like 85 C0) and then a conditional jump near (74 or 75). If I combine E8 with the next four bytes: E8 85 C0 ?? etc., but maybe that's too long. Alternatively, just focus on the E8 instruction and its immediate offset.\n\nBut since E8 is followed by some addresses, perhaps taking a few more instructions to make it specific enough without being too long.\n\nSimilarly, for the second pattern starting with 74, take the next four bytes after that.\n\nAnd for the third, maybe use 0F 84 ?? as part of the pattern.\n\nI think I have three distinct patterns now:\n\n1. E8 followed by four unknowns: {E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n2. 74 followed by four unknowns: {74 ?? ?? ??}\n3. 0F followed by an unknown: {0F ??}\n\nBut wait, the third one is only two bytes. I need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes.\n\nSo perhaps for each of these, include more surrounding instructions to reach at least 6 bytes.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\n1. E8 and the next four addresses: {E8 85 C0 ?? ????} Hmm, but that's not right because I need to capture the specific offset after E8.\n\nWait, looking back, after E8 is called with some offset (let's say it's at address X), then there are more instructions. Maybe the exit path uses a conditional jump near (74 0A or 75 0B) followed by another call to 0F 84.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exit involves two calls: E8 with an offset and then 0F 84 without any displacement.\n\nSo maybe:\n\nPattern1: E8 + four unknowns after (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??)\nPattern2: 74 ??: which is a conditional jump near. So {74 ??}\nBut to make it longer, include the next few instructions: 74 ?? 0F 84 ?? ????\nWait, that might be too long.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern1: E8 + four unknowns (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??)\nPattern2: 74 followed by some addresses and then 0F 84\nBut I need to include enough bytes for each pattern.\n\nPerhaps taking more instructions after the key points to make the patterns longer without including too much irrelevant code.\n\nI think it's best to capture specific sequences where address/offsets are replaced with ??, while keeping opcodes concrete.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern1: E8 followed by four unknowns (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??) \u2013 6 bytes\nPattern2: 74 followed by four unknowns (74 ?? ?? ??) \u2013 5 bytes, which is too short. So maybe add another instruction after.\nIf the next instruction is moving a register, like 0F 84 ?? ????, but that's part of a call.\n\nWait, looking back at the trace:\n\nThere are lines like 8B 45 ??: which is pushing a value onto the stack.\n\nSo perhaps combining these instructions to create longer patterns.\n\nBut I need each pattern to be specific enough. Maybe combine E8 with the next four bytes after it: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes)\n\nFor the second pattern, starting at 74 ??:\n\nIf it's followed by some addresses and then a call to 0F 84, perhaps take those into account.\n\nBut I need three distinct patterns. Let me think of each one clearly.\n\nFirst Pattern: E8 followed by four unknowns (6 bytes)\nSecond Pattern: 74 followed by five unknowns (including the next instruction which is ??) \u2013 but that's too short.\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nIn the trace, after 74 ?? there's an unconditional jump to another call.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps capturing a conditional jump near and then the call to bypass.\n\nSo maybe the second pattern starts with 74 followed by five unknowns: {74 ?? ?? ??} \u2013 but that's only four bytes if I count including 74. So maybe not enough.\n\nThird Pattern: Maybe starting at another point, like after a push and before the exit.\n\nLooking back, there are multiple calls to E8 with offsets. Another possible pattern is using the call to E8 followed by some other operation.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to focus on three clear bypass points:\n\n1. Using E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n2. Using 74 ?? ?? ?? ??\n3. Using 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nEach of these can be expanded into patterns with enough bytes, replacing address/offsets with ??.\n\nBut I need each pattern to be between 6-20 bytes.\n\nLet me adjust:\n\nPattern1: E8 followed by four unknowns (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??) \u2013 6 bytes\nPattern2: The first conditional jump near at 74 followed by four unknowns (74 ?? ?? ?? ??) \u2013 but that's only five bytes. So perhaps include the next instruction, which is a call to E8 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, use a longer sequence after 74:\n\nIf it's 74 ?? and then some other instructions before the actual bypass, maybe I can capture more.\n\nBut without knowing exactly what comes next, it's safer to create specific patterns that are known to be valid.\n\nI think three distinct patterns would be sufficient. Each will include a different instruction sequence from the trace where addresses or offsets are replaced with ??.\n</think>\n\nTo create a Yara rule based on the provided trace, we first identify the exit path by analyzing the conditional jumps and function calls. The exit likely involves two key points: a `CALL E8` followed by another `CALL 0F 84`. We then craft three distinct bypass patterns targeting these points.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help the user generate a corrected YARA bypass rule based on their trace data. Let's break down what they need and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, the task is to extract exactly three different patterns from the provided trace instructions. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offset bytes while keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete. \n\nLooking at the trace data, I see a lot of repeated instructions like E8 calls and memory accesses. For example, there's an E8 instruction followed by four question marks (??), which likely represents four offset bytes being replaced with wildcards. Similarly, other instructions have specific opcodes that can be kept as they are.\n\nThe user provided examples in the good section help guide how to structure these patterns. They included a mix of conditional jumps, memory accesses, and calls. So I need to find three distinct sequences from their trace data that fit into this format.\n\nI'll start by identifying sequences with E8 followed by four wildcards since those have variable offsets, making them good candidates for bypass patterns. Then, I can look for other instructions like TEST or conditional jumps (74/75) that also have multiple wildcards after them. Memory accesses with ?? could be another source.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different instruction sequences from the trace. Also, each must meet the 6-20 byte requirement by combining consecutive instructions where possible without including unnecessary data.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these patterns according to YARA's syntax, replacing address bytes with ?? and keeping opcodes concrete. Then, I'll add the necessary meta information like description and cape_options for the rule to work effectively.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting stack calls and memory accesses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 75 0C ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to create a Yara rule based on the given trace and follow the reasoning strategy provided. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace, it's quite long, but I notice that around line 41, there are some interesting instructions like E8740A00, which probably calls a function named EAE7h. That seems suspicious because if an attacker is trying to bypass, they might be calling this function and then exiting the program.\n\nSo, in Phase 2, I need to consider each instruction that could potentially be skipped to prevent the exit. The key here would be to find where the call happens and see what comes right after it. If skipping a few instructions after the call could redirect the flow or prevent the exit, that's our target.\n\nLooking at line 41: E8740A00 calls 0041EAE7h. After that, there are several instructions adding to the stack and then moving data around. If we can skip these and find a way back, maybe by popping some registers or jumping somewhere else.\n\nNow, for the patterns, I need to capture the E8 instruction and the following bytes where it's called from. So something like \"E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F C0 ...\". But wait, the exact sequence might vary because of wildcards needed for addresses.\n\nI also need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes. For example, taking E8 and the next four bytes as wildcards would be too short, so I should include a few more instructions after the call but before the exit.\n\nThen, in Phase 3, I'll evaluate if skipping these lines makes sense. If skipping them allows execution to continue without exiting, that's good. Each pattern needs to be unique and cover different parts of the code to avoid triggering other issues.\n\nFinally, putting it all together into Yara format with three patterns, each capturing a different bypass point after the call.\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected YARA rule based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass for stack overflow\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? 0F C0 ?? ??\n                      8B 45 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? 74 8A ?? ??\n                      ?? 83 C4 0F 84 ?? ?? ??}\n        $pattern2 = { E8 ?? 6A ?? 5A\n                      8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n                      85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
