Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to create a better YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. Let's start by understanding what the current situation is.\n\nFrom the original trace provided, there are several call instructions leading up to an exit process. The key steps involve moving values between registers (like rcx, rax) and using conditional jumps like je and jne. \n\nThe user mentioned that their current best rule didn't find any new signatures, so I need to think about why that might be happening. Maybe the previous patterns were too broad or didn't match specific enough parts of the trace.\n\nLooking at Strategy A, which focuses on the first 30% of the trace with a pattern involving test eAx and je/jne. Since the exit process is towards the end, maybe this strategy isn't effective because it's looking in the wrong place.\n\nStrategy B suggests checking before the exit call. That makes sense since sometimes exits have conditions that bypassers need to handle. Strategy C involves unique techniques like RDTSC or CPUID, which might be too specific and not present here.\n\nThe user also emphasized that all patterns must come directly from the trace data without guessing. So I need to extract possible 6-20 byte sequences from the given trace instructions.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n1. The first few instructions are pushing values onto the stack (push rbx, sub rsp, etc.), then a call to another function.\n2. There are several calls with offsets like [00007FF778B2A0A8h] and similar addresses.\n3. Towards the end, there's a series of calls, including one at 00007FF778B18A1Ch.\n\nSince the exit is via call qword ptr [...], perhaps looking for patterns around these calls would be useful.\n\nI can extract possible byte sequences from these calls:\n\n- The first call has hex: 84C0 (test al, al) followed by je/jne. But wait, in the trace, after sub rsp, there's a call with offset [00007FF778B2A0A8h]. That might be a potential pattern.\n\nAnother part is when it calls qword ptr at 00007FF778B18A1Ch. The bytes around here are FF153F180100, which corresponds to the call instruction with a specific address.\n\nAlso, before the exit, there's a je 00007FF778B18A0Ah, which could be part of a conditional jump sequence.\n\nPutting this together, I can create three distinct patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern looks for a test eAx followed by a je/jne.\n2. The second finds the specific call to qword ptr with the given address.\n3. The third identifies the conditional jump before exiting.\n\nEach pattern is extracted directly from the trace and uses wildcards where necessary, ensuring they match only in the correct locations.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: \nThe current approach failed because it didn't focus on the exit decision point before the actual termination. By targeting specific calls and jumps near the exit, we can bypass them more effectively.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: API_CHECK (for conditional checks), EXIST_DECISION (before exit call)\n\n**REASONING**: Extracting exact sequences from known call points increases specificity to avoid false positives while ensuring they match at the correct exit decision point.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - targeted exit decision checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 84C0 7411 FF153F180100 }\n        $pattern1 = { E827000000 8BCB FF15A9160100 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF151E170100 488C }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Let me break down what needs to be done step by step.\n\nFirst, the original rule is missing some basic structure: it doesn't have the meta section with a description or the required `cape_options`. It only has three patterns but lacks proper syntax in the strings section. Also, the condition isn't correctly set up.\n\nLooking at the validation errors, the main issues are:\n1. Missing basic Yara rule structure (name, meta, etc.)\n2. The strings section doesn't have enough patterns or correct syntax.\n\nThe task requires generating exactly three different 6-20 byte patterns using instructions from the given trace data. Each pattern should include wildcards for address/offset bytes and be specific enough to match only certain locations.\n\nLet me look at the trace data provided:\n\nThe call instruction happens at E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45, which is a call with an offset of 0x25 (since 8B in hex is 147 in decimal). So one possible pattern could be capturing this specific call and its surrounding context.\n\nAnother call I notice is the 85 C0 instruction at position $pattern0. It's followed by some bytes, so maybe a second pattern can capture that.\n\nThe third pattern might involve the E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 sequence but with different surrounding instructions to make it unique.\n\nI need to create three distinct patterns:\n1. One capturing the first call at E8.\n2. Another focusing on the 85 C0 instruction.\n3. A third that includes a different set of instructions, maybe combining E8 and another nearby instruction for specificity.\n\nEach pattern should be between 6-20 bytes long. I'll have to include enough context after each instruction, using wildcards where necessary.\n\nNow, structuring the Yara rule:\n\n- Meta section with description and `cape_options`.\n- Strings section with three patterns: $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2.\n- Condition set to \"any of them\".\n\nI need to ensure that each pattern is unique and captures different sequences from the trace. Also, all address/offset bytes should be replaced with ??.\n\nLet me draft the patterns:\n\nPattern 0: E8 followed by four wildcards (for offset), then 8B 45.\nSo: $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 }\n\nPattern 1: 85 C0 and surrounding bytes. Maybe include some context to make it specific, like the next instruction after 85 C0 is 0F 84, then four wildcards.\nSo: $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\nPattern 2: E8 again but with different following instructions. Maybe include 83 C4 (which follows in the trace) and some more bytes before 85 C0.\n$pattern2 = { E8 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? }\n\nWait, let me check the instruction sequence:\n\nLooking at the trace:\n- After E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? comes 8B 45 (call)\nThen after that, there's 83 C4, then another call to E8.\n\nSo Pattern 2 could be starting with E8 and including the next instructions up to before the second call. So maybe:\n\nE8 followed by two wildcards, then 83 C4, four wildcards, 85 C0, etc.\n\nBut I need exactly three patterns, each capturing a different part of the trace without overlapping too much.\n\nAlternatively, Pattern 2 could be another set involving E8 but with more specific surrounding bytes to differentiate from Pattern 0.\n\nI think it's better to have each pattern capture unique sequences. Let me adjust:\n\nPattern 1: Focus on the first call (E8) and its offset.\nPattern 2: Capture a sequence that includes both E8 and another instruction, like moving E8 with ?? but ensuring it doesn't match Pattern 0.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for other instructions in the trace. For example, after E8 is 8B 45 (call), then further down there's an 83 C4.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 2 could be starting at E8 and including some bytes before and after to make it unique from Pattern 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps combining E8 with the next instruction that isn't in Pattern 1. Alternatively, create a pattern that includes more specific instructions like 83 C4.\n\nBut I need to keep each pattern as 6-20 bytes. Let me finalize:\n\n$pattern0 = {E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45}\n$pattern1 = {85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n$pattern2 = {E8 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0}\n\nWait, but $pattern2 is only 6 bytes. Let me add more to make it 10-12.\n\nMaybe: E8 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? \n\nThat's 12 bytes.\n\nYes, that should work. So each pattern captures a unique sequence:\n\nPattern 0 is the first call.\nPattern 1 includes the 85 C0 and some surrounding instructions.\nPattern 2 combines E8 with another instruction (83 C4) to create a different context.\n\nI think this setup meets all the requirements: three distinct patterns, each around 6-12 bytes, using wildcards for offsets, and including concrete opcode and register bytes where applicable.\n\nNow, putting it all together in the Yara rule.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting calls with wildcards\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { E8 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
