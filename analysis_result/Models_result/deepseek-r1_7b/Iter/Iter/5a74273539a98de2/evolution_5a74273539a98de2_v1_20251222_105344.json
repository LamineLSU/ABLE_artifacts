      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to create a YARA rule for this evasion bypass. Let's start by looking at the traces provided.\n\nFrom the first trace, it looks like the exit is happening at 0040E7F6 with some calls made before that. The second trace also ends up at 0040E7FF similarly. Then there are traces starting from higher addresses like 00B9A9DC and others.\n\nLooking at each trace, I notice a lot of conditional jumps and function calls. For example, in the first two traces, after some operations, it's calling dword ptr [0041B0ACh]. In the third trace, there's a call to 0040E7C3h.\n\nI think the main idea is that these evasions are using certain jump instructions like JE or JNZ followed by calls. To bypass them, we need to find where these jumps and calls are happening in the code.\n\nIn the third and fourth traces, I see a call to 0041B0ACh, which seems to be a hardcoded address. Maybe this is part of the evasion because it's forcing the program to jump there instead of continuing normally.\n\nLooking at the fifth trace starting from 00B9A9DC, it calls 00BAE13Ch and then another offset. So perhaps these are trying to bypass jumps by using specific call offsets.\n\nI remember that in x86, certain instructions like TEST or CMP can be used to control conditional jumps. For example, if you have a TEST followed by a JZ, it checks the value of EAX after the test. So maybe the evaders are setting up these conditions so the jump doesn't occur, causing an exit.\n\nLooking at the patterns from the traces:\n\nIn trace 3 and 4: They call 0041B0ACh after some operations.\nTrace 5 calls two different offsets after a test.\n\nSo possible bypass candidates could be:\n- The TEST instruction before the JZ\n- The JZ or JE instructions that cause the function to jump\n- The function calls (like E8C8FFFFFF and FF15ACB04100) which are used for jumping to specific addresses\n\nI think each of these can be candidates because if any of them are bypassed, it could allow the program to exit without following the intended path.\n\nNow, I need to create patterns that include these candidate instructions with wildcards where necessary. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long and combined from consecutive instructions.\n\nFor example:\n1. A pattern starting with TEST EAX followed by JZ or a conditional jump.\n2. Another pattern focusing on the function calls used for bypassing.\n3. A third pattern involving the setup before the jump, like pushing registers and then calling the evading code.\n\nI'll have to make sure each pattern is unique but derived from the trace data. Also, replace all address/offset bytes with ?? to use wildcards.\n\nLet me try to draft these patterns step by step.\n</think>\n\nTo create a YARA rule for bypassing the observed evasion paths in the provided traces, we need to identify and exploit common conditional jumps and function calls used in the exit process. By analyzing the trace data, we can extract potential bypass instructions that could be targeted.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Evasion Paths:**\n   - The traces show multiple `CALL` instructions with hardcoded addresses, such as 0x41b0ach and others.\n   - Conditional jumps like JZ (Jump if Zero) are used before these calls to control the flow.\n\n2. **Determine Bypass Candidates:**\n   - **Candidate 1:** The sequence involving a TEST instruction followed by a JZ or JE, which can bypass subsequent code based on EAX's value.\n   - **Candidate 2:** A function call (like E8C8FFFFFF) used to jump to an evasion address. This offset is fixed and known from the trace.\n   - **Candidate 3:** The setup before a jump, including pushing registers with `EBEC` and moving values into registers like EAX.\n\n### Constructing Patterns:\n\nEach pattern will be constructed by combining consecutive instructions from the traces, ensuring it's between 6-20 bytes long. Wildcards (??) are used for address/offset bytes to remain specific without exact offsets.\n\n#### Pattern 1:\nThis pattern targets a conditional jump followed by an evading call.\n```\n85 C0 0F 84 ?? ??.??.??? 8B 45 ?? ??.??.??? 0F 3C\n```\n\n#### Pattern 2:\nThis pattern focuses on the hardcoded offset used in the function call.\n```\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ??.??.??? 59 ?? ??.??.??? FF C8\n```\n\n#### Pattern 3:\nThis pattern captures the setup before a jump, such as pushing registers and then making an evading call.\n```\nEB EC 0F 7E 8B 4D 0F 5A E8 ??.??.??? 59 ?? ??.??.??? FF C8\n```\n\n### YARA Rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass through conditional jumps and function calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {85 C0 0F 84 ?? ??.??.??? 8B 45 ?? ??.??.??? 0F 3C}\n        $pattern1 = {6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ??.??.??? 59 ?? ??.??.???

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to create a YARA rule for an evasion bypass based on the provided trace data. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all suspicious instructions in the trace. From the given data, it looks like there are several function calls and conditional jumps that could be part of the evasion strategy. Instructions like TEST, EAX, conditional jumps (JE, JZ), CALL, and so on seem relevant here.\n\nNext, I'll trace backward from the exit point to understand what instruction caused the exit. Looking at the last few traces before the exit, I see calls to functions with specific offsets, which might indicate that a condition was checked to decide whether to jump out or continue.\n\nNow, I need to select three different bypass candidates. These should be instructions that can potentially bypass the checked conditions without altering their execution flow otherwise.\n\nFor each candidate, I'll create patterns by combining it with adjacent instructions and include any necessary context. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long and use wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nI have to ensure that each pattern is unique and doesn't duplicate any other patterns from the trace. Also, all address and offset bytes should be replaced with `??` as per the rules.\n\nLet me start by identifying three distinct instruction sequences from the trace:\n\n1. The first sequence includes TEST EAX, compare with 0x84 (132), and then a conditional jump using JZ or JE.\n2. The second sequence involves a function call to dword ptr [0x5A], a pop operation on EAX, another function call to dword ptr +68h, and finally TEST EAX again.\n3. The third sequence starts with a push of 0x6A (106), followed by a pop from the stack, then a conditional jump using JNZ.\n\nEach of these sequences will form one pattern, ensuring they are distinct and cover different parts of the trace to make bypassing more effective.\n\nFinally, I'll format each pattern correctly with wildcards for address/offset bytes and include them in the YARA rule under the strings section. Also, don't forget to add the necessary meta information including the cape_options.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Evasion_Bypass\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass exploiting conditional jumps and memory accesses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 75 00 00 00 00 83 C4 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a Yara rule for bypassing an evasion. From what I understand, the goal is to find instructions in the trace that could be used to bypass some security check. The user provided several traces and wants me to extract suspicious instructions, trace back from the exit point, pick three different patterns, build them into 6-20 byte sequences with wildcards, and then format it correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the trace data provided. It seems like there are multiple calls and some conditional jumps. The target appears to be a call to an address, as seen in the exit instructions like `FF158CE1BA00` which points back to `00BAE18Ch`. So, maybe the bypass involves skipping this call or manipulating the stack.\n\nI'll start by identifying suspicious instructions. Any TEST or CMP followed by conditional jumps (JE, JZ) could be part of an evasion. Also, function calls like CALL and their surrounding bytes are likely candidates for bypass.\n\nNext, I need to trace back from the exit point. The last instruction before exiting is `FF158CE1BA00` which is a call to `00BAE18Ch`. Before that, in the trace under \"REASONING STRATEGY,\" there's an instruction at `00B9A9DC` where another call happens. This might be part of the chain.\n\nLooking closer, before each call, there are TEST or CMP instructions followed by conditional jumps. For example, in one trace snippet, after a TEST and a conditional jump (JZ), there's a call to an address. So maybe bypassing these would involve skipping the test or changing the condition.\n\nNow, I need to pick three different patterns from the trace that can be used to create bypass sequences. Each pattern should combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into a hex sequence with wildcards for addresses and offsets.\n\nFor example, one possible pattern could be combining a TEST instruction, a conditional jump (like JZ), and a call. Another might involve a series of pushes and pops combined with a conditional jump. The third could be another combination involving different instructions like EAX, conditional jumps, and memory access.\n\nI have to ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards where address/offset bytes are present. Also, all opcodes and register encodings should remain concrete.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the patterns don't include any hardcoded addresses or offsets because that would make them invalid. So every memory access instruction's offset must be replaced with `??`.\n\nLet me try drafting each pattern:\n\n1. Pattern 0: TEST EAX followed by JZ (offset ??) then a call. Combining these might look like `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`.\n2. Pattern 1: A series of instructions before the target call, maybe including a push and pop with a conditional jump. For example, EAX instruction followed by JZ (offset), then another push and a call.\n3. Pattern 2: Another combination, perhaps involving a different set of opcodes like EAX again but with a different condition or offset.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, I must include all the necessary bytes, including any conditional jumps' offsets and calls.\n\nOnce these patterns are crafted, they should be combined into the Yara rule with the correct syntax for each part: the meta description, the cape_options with references to the patterns, and then the three strings with the hex sequences wrapped in braces.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting call address\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create a Yara rule for bypassing an evasion. From what I understand, the goal is to find instructions in the trace that could be used to bypass some security check. The user provided several traces and wants me to extract suspicious instructions, trace back from the exit point, pick three different patterns, build them into 6-20 byte sequences with wildcards, and then format it correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the trace data provided. It seems like there are multiple calls and some conditional jumps. The target appears to be a call to an address, as seen in the exit instructions like `FF158CE1BA00` which points back to `00BAE18Ch`. So, maybe the bypass involves skipping this call or manipulating the stack.\n\nI'll start by identifying suspicious instructions. Any TEST or CMP followed by conditional jumps (JE, JZ) could be part of an evasion. Also, function calls like CALL and their surrounding bytes are likely candidates for bypass.\n\nNext, I need to trace back from the exit point. The last instruction before exiting is `FF158CE1BA00` which is a call to `00BAE18Ch`. Before that, in the trace under \"REASONING STRATEGY,\" there's an instruction at `00B9A9DC` where another call happens. This might be part of the chain.\n\nLooking closer, before each call, there are TEST or CMP instructions followed by conditional jumps. For example, in one trace snippet, after a TEST and a conditional jump (JZ), there's a call to an address. So maybe bypassing these would involve skipping the test or changing the condition.\n\nNow, I need to pick three different patterns from the trace that can be used to create bypass sequences. Each pattern should combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into a hex sequence with wildcards for addresses and offsets.\n\nFor example, one possible pattern could be combining a TEST instruction, a conditional jump (like JZ), and a call. Another might involve a series of pushes and pops combined with a conditional jump. The third could be another combination involving different instructions like EAX, conditional jumps, and memory access.\n\nI have to ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards where address/offset bytes are present. Also, all opcodes and register encodings should remain concrete.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that the patterns don't include any hardcoded addresses or offsets because that would make them invalid. So every memory access instruction's offset must be replaced with `??`.\n\nLet me try drafting each pattern:\n\n1. Pattern 0: TEST EAX followed by JZ (offset ??) then a call. Combining these might look like `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??`.\n2. Pattern 1: A series of instructions before the target call, maybe including a push and pop with a conditional jump. For example, EAX instruction followed by JZ (offset), then another push and a call.\n3. Pattern 2: Another combination, perhaps involving a different set of opcodes like EAX again but with a different condition or offset.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, I must include all the necessary bytes, including any conditional jumps' offsets and calls.\n\nOnce these patterns are crafted, they should be combined into the Yara rule with the correct syntax for each part: the meta description, the cape_options with references to the patterns, and then the three strings with the hex sequences wrapped in braces.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting call address\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
