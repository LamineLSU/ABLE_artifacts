      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user correct their Yara rule based on the provided information. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe user has a previous Yara rule that's incorrect because it's missing some required elements and doesn't meet all the criteria. Their task is to generate a corrected version using exactly three patterns from the given trace data. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long, use wildcards for address/offsets, and include opcode and register bytes concretely.\n\nFirst, I'll review the validation errors: missing basic YARA structure (meta section), incorrect strings format, and no CAPE rule generation. The corrected task mentions that the previous attempt failed these validations.\n\nLooking at the trace data, there are five traces with different instruction sequences. My goal is to extract three distinct patterns from these traces, each meeting the length and wildcard requirements.\n\nI'll start by examining the instructions in the traces. Each pattern should target a specific point where an evasion might occur. Let me pick one instruction sequence that has enough context around it to form a 6-20 byte pattern with wildcards for addresses.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1, I see the following relevant part:\n85C0 (test eax), then some push/pop operations, and then E8CE (call dword ptr [ebp-04h]). This seems like a good candidate because it has multiple instructions around the call. I can combine these into one pattern.\n\nNext, from TRACE #2, there's an 85C0 instruction followed by a series of push/pop and then FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00B0ACh]). This is another distinct sequence that doesn't repeat the first pattern.\n\nFrom TRACE #3, I notice E8C8FFFFFF (call dword ptr [ebp+08h]) followed by a call to 00B7C3h. However, this might not provide enough context for a 6-20 byte pattern. Maybe another part of TRACE #3 can be used.\n\nWait, in TRACE #5, there's FF15ACB04100 (call dword ptr [00B0ACh]) again. That could form the third distinct pattern if combined with surrounding instructions.\n\nSo, my three patterns would be:\n1. 85C0 followed by push ebp and mov esp, then E8CE call.\n2. Similar steps but from a different trace: 85C0, push ebp, etc., leading to FF15ACB04100.\n3. Another instruction sequence with 6A..., maybe including more pushes and pops.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards where applicable, and keeps opcodes and registers concrete. Let me structure each pattern accordingly.\n\nFor the first pattern: 85C0, then push ebp (0F84), mov esp (08B4). Then E8CE call with offset ??.\nSo, {85 C0 0F 84 ?? 08 B4 E8 CE ??} but check byte count.\n\nWait, that's only 10 bytes. I need to add more context. Maybe include the surrounding push/pop instructions before and after.\n\nActually, each pattern should be a sequence of multiple consecutive instructions. So combining 2-3 instructions into one pattern might not give enough length. Alternatively, maybe combine three or four instructions from the trace.\n\nWait, perhaps each pattern is formed by two to three consecutive instructions that include the target call instruction with surrounding context.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nPattern1: From TRACE #1:\n85 C0 0F 84 ?? 08 B4 E8 CE ?? → Maybe this is too short. Let's expand it by adding more bytes from before and after to make it 6-20 bytes.\n\nActually, each pattern should be a sequence of consecutive instructions that includes the target instruction plus enough context to match only at that location. So combining multiple instructions into one pattern might work.\n\nI think I need to form three distinct patterns, each derived from different traces, each meeting the length requirement and using wildcards appropriately.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here are the three patterns:\n\n1. 85C0 (test eax), push ebp, mov esp, then E8CE call.\n2. Similar steps but leading to FF15ACB04100.\n3. Another instruction sequence from a different trace with enough context.\n\nEach pattern will be constructed by combining multiple consecutive instructions into one hex string, using wildcards for address/offset bytes and keeping opcodes and registers concrete.\n\nFinally, the meta section needs to include the correct description and cape_options with three patterns referenced correctly.\n</think>\n\n```\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific memory addresses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? 08 B4 E8 CE ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??

The task is to generate exactly three different patterns targeting specific evasion points using the given trace data.\n\nLooking at the trace data from five traces, I can see that each has similar structures with calls and memory accesses. My goal is to extract three unique 6-20 bytes patterns.\n\nI'll start by identifying potential instruction sequences that include addresses or displacements, which need to be replaced with wildcards (??).\n\nFrom TRACE #1:\n- The call at E825050000 could form a pattern: { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\nThis includes the call instruction and surrounding context.\n\nFrom TRACE #2:\n- Another call at E84B170000 can be used: { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\nThis captures a different set of instructions with wildcards.\n\nFor the third pattern, I'll look for another instance in TRACE #3 and #4:\n- The call at E8C8FFFFFF can be turned into: { FF15ACB04100 ??? }\n\nNow, ensuring each pattern is 6-20 bytes long.

      "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace and feedback. The goal is to evolve from previous attempts where the rule didn't hit any new signatures. \n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, there are two exit process traces (TRACE #1 and TRACE #2) with various instructions. I need to find patterns that can be used for bypass.\n\nStrategy A suggests targeting the first 30% of the trace, specifically a call followed by test eax and je/jne. Looking at the trace, the first few lines in TRACE #1 have a call at 00B561F8 with E825050000, which is a 20-byte instruction. Then it does a test eax, then je.\n\nSo one pattern could be looking for \"call\" followed by test eax and je/jne within the first 30% of any trace.\n\nNext, Strategy B mentions checking before the exit call, but since we already covered the early call in Strategy A, maybe another approach is needed. However, since the rule didn't hit previous patterns, perhaps moving the bypass earlier or considering a different target might help.\n\nLooking at the trace again, there's a mov to 00B51140h and then a call dword ptr [00B5A12Ch]. That seems like an exit with conditional logic. Maybe using that as another pattern.\n\nFor Strategy C, which is more advanced techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID, it's less likely since the previous attempts didn't find any matches. So focusing on the first two strategies might be better.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, using exact hex values from the trace without wildcards where possible for specificity but allowing some address offsets with ?? if necessary.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create three patterns: one targeting the early call/test/je as per Strategy A, another looking at the conditional exit in Strategy B, and a third maybe combining RDTSC timing or something else specific. Wait, but since we need to use only what's in the trace, perhaps including the mov and call as part of the pattern.\n\nSo final patterns:\n\n1. Call followed by test eax and je/jne\n2. Conditional check before exit (like conditional mov or if-then-else)\n3. Some unique instruction sequence for another bypass point\n\nI'll make sure each is 6-20 bytes, using exact hexs where possible, and wildcards for varying parts.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original rule attempts didn't find new signatures due to matching the wrong locations. Re-focusing on specific patterns from the trace's early calls and conditional exits improves specificity.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | CONDITIONAL_EXIT_CHECK | RDTSC TIMING\n\n**REASONING**: By targeting known call sequences and conditional exit points, these patterns are more likely to bypass without matching other code paths.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 FC }  -- Targeting the early call/test/je pattern\n        $pattern1 = { E9B5FCFFFF, A18885B500, FF152CA1B500 }  -- Conditional exit check before call\n        $pattern2 = { 3D00100000000001, ??.???????+0F, ... }  -- Unique instruction sequence for timing bypass\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
