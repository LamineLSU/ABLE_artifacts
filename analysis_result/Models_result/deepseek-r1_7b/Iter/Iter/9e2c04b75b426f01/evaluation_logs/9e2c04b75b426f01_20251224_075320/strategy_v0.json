        "prompt_length": 9492,
        "prompt_tokens": 2373,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given traces to find three different bypass rules targeting suspicious points. Each rule must be 6-20 bytes long and follow specific wildcard and concrete byte rules.\n\nFirst, looking at Trace #3: There's a call at 0040E7C3h which is being called from two different places in Trace #5. The first call is made by the code starting at 0013A9D0 with some instructions involving push and pop. Then another similar call happens, suggesting an evasion point around the function called here.\n\nLooking at the trace data for Trace #4: It's a similar setup where the same function is being evaded twice. The first time it goes through the code starting at 0013A9D0 (the good example), and then again. So this seems like two different instances of the same evasion.\n\nIn Trace #5, there are multiple calls to functions like E7C3h, F4BCh, etc., which might indicate various evasions happening in different parts of the code.\n\nSo for each target, I need to find a sequence that includes the call instruction and surrounding context. Let's break it down:\n\nFor the first pattern: In Trace #5, there's an E7C3h function being called from two different points. Each time, before the call, there are some instructions like push ebp, mov edi, etc., which can be combined to form a bypass.\n\nLooking at the code in Trace #4 and #5: The sequence starts with 8BFF (mov edi), then push ebp, then push ebp again. So that's two pushes on top of each other, moving from ebp to another stack frame perhaps.\n\nThen, the call instruction is E8C8FFFFFFh which seems like a special opcode for jumping multiple calls. Following that are pop instructions and some moves, but those can be part of the context or included in the pattern.\n\nSo combining these, I can form a 12-byte pattern: \n\n8B FF (mov edi) \n55 (push ebp)\n8B EC (mov ebp from esp)\nE8 C8 FFFF (call with jump)\nThen pop and other instructions can be either kept as wildcards or included if known.\n\nSo the first pattern would capture this specific call path. The bytes are:\n\n0x8B, 0xFF, 0x55, 0x8B, 0xEC, 0xE8, 0xC8, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x59, 0xFF, 0xC8\n\nWait, but the call is E8C8FFFFFFh which is 12 bytes. So including that would make a longer pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just capturing the essential part: push ebp twice and the call with offset.\n\nBut to cover all steps before the call, let's include more bytes:\n\nSo from 0x8BFF (mov edi), then push ebp, mov ebp from esp, E8C8FFFF (call), pop ecx, then pop dword ptr, etc. But that might be too long.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the specific jump: maybe a pattern starting with 8B FF 55 8B EC followed by E8 C8 FFFF is sufficient but might not capture all evasions yet.\n\nWait, in Trace #3 and #4, similar sequences are used. So perhaps that's one pattern.\n\nNext, looking at other traces: In Trace #2 and #1, the call to C3E0h is being made after some pushes and pops. Maybe another pattern can be formed from there.\n\nIn Trace #5, when the function E7C3h is called multiple times with similar surrounding code. So perhaps a different push sequence or offset used here.\n\nI need to extract three distinct sequences:\n\nPattern 1: From the call in Trace #4/5 using the long jump (E8 C8 FFFF) after two pushes and a mov ebp.\nPattern 2: The good example from Trace #3, which is a series of push, pop, mov, etc., leading to a specific call.\nPattern 3: Another evasive path perhaps in another part of the code.\n\nWait, looking at Trace #5 again, there's an FF15ACB04100h and FF152CA1..., which might be different calls with varying offsets. So maybe that can form a third pattern.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on specific register movements:\n\nIn Trace #3: 8BFF 55 8BEC E8C8FFFF is the initial part before the first call. Then after some pops and movs, another similar sequence happens in another branch.\n\nSo perhaps three patterns are:\n\n1. Pattern capturing two pushes and a jump:\n   0x8B FF 55 8B EC E8 C8 FFFF\n\n2. The good example: combining push, pop, mov, call, test.\n   6A 5A 8B CE E8 ...\n\n3. Another evasive path, perhaps in the first trace, which uses a different offset or pattern.\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is unique and captures specific context around the calls.\n\nLet me structure them:\n\nPattern1: From Trace #4/5:\n- 0x8B FF (mov edi)\n- 0x55 (push ebp)\n- 0x8B EC (mov ebp from esp)\n- 0xE8 C8 FFFF (call with offset)\n\nSo the first part is 8BFF558BEC followed by E8C8FFFF. That's 12 bytes.\n\nPattern2: From Trace #3:\nStarts with push ebp, mov ebp to esp, then call E7C3h.\nBut in the code, it's E8 C8 FFFF followed by pop and etc., but maybe a shorter pattern is:\n\n0xE8 C8 FFFF (call) preceded by some pushes.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for another sequence before the call. Maybe 55 8BEC E8C8FFFF as part of a different context.\n\nAlternatively, find an instruction where the same function is called with similar surrounding code but in a different place.\n\nAnother approach: Looking at Trace #2:\n\nThere's FF15ACB04100h which might be another call. The code before that includes pushes and pops.\n\nWait, maybe three patterns are:\n\nPattern 1 (Trace #4/5): E8C8FFFF preceded by two pushes.\nPattern 2 (Trace #3): E7C3h with similar push steps.\nPattern 3: Another evasive pattern in a different area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each trace offers one unique bypass path. For example:\n\n- Trace #1 and #2 have the same initial code but lead to different calls.\n- Trace #3 has two separate call instances.\n- Trace #4 has another similar instance.\n\nSo combining these into three distinct patterns.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to pick specific segments from each trace that capture unique paths.\n\nI think I need to list three specific 6-20 byte sequences, each capturing a different bypass scenario, all derived from the given traces using wildcards where needed.\n</think>\n\nTo create YARA bypass rules based on the provided traces, we analyze the call patterns and surrounding instructions.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace data and feedback. Let's break down what I know.\n\nFirst, the previous attempt used a pattern that didn't match correctly, resulting in no new signatures. The goal is to adjust the rules so they hit more accurately without false positives.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided for TRACe #1, I see several places where there are calls and checks. Strategy A suggests looking for a call followed by a test eax and je or jne. That seems promising because bypassing these points can lead to early termination.\n\nIn the trace, the first 30% of the instructions include lines like:\n- test eax, eax\n- je 00B56190h\n- push 0000005Bh\n\nBut since it's a call, I need to find where that call is. For example, \"E825050000\" is a call instruction. So maybe the pattern should be looking for a call followed by test eax and je.\n\nSimilarly, Strategy B might look for conditional checks before an exit, which could also be effective if A doesn't work.\n\nI need to extract patterns from the trace data without making them too broad. Each pattern must have 6-20 bytes and use wildcards where necessary.\n\nLet me try creating three different patterns:\n\n1. The first pattern is a call followed by test eax, je/jne.\n   - Example: E825050000 (call), then 85C0 (test), 7412 (je)\n   - So the hex sequence would be \"E8 25 05 00 00 85 C0 74 12\"\n\n2. The second pattern could look for a different call and check, perhaps with different offsets.\n   - Maybe E8CEFAFFFF (another call) followed by test eax and je\n   - So: E8 CE FA FF FF 85 C0 74 12\n\n3. The third pattern might target a conditional move or something similar found later in the trace, ensuring it's specific to the exit point.\n\nI have to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace to avoid false matches while still catching the bypass.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**:  \nThe previous rule didn't match correctly because it focused on the wrong location. By targeting earlier calls followed by test eax and je, we ensure bypassing points that trigger early termination.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70  \n\n**REASONING**: Focusing on specific call sequences ensures accurate bypass while avoiding false positives by matching only relevant exit decision points.  \n\n**YARA_RULE**:  \n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 0xE8 0x25 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x85 0xC0 0x74 0x12 }\n        $pattern1 = { 0xE8 0xCE 0xFA 0xFF 0xFF 0x85 0xC0 0x74 0x12 }\n        $pattern2 = { 0x8B 0x4D 0xF9 0x2A 0x3F 0x06 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to generate a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace data. The user wants three different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, and they must come from the given trace.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the traces to find sequences of instructions that might indicate evasions or potential bypass opportunities. Since each trace has multiple calls like E8C8FFFF and calls to C3h, these are likely points where evasions could happen.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1: There's a call to E8C8FFFF followed by 8B4068 (mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]). Then there's another call to C3h. This suggests that between the two calls, some manipulation is done on the stack or memory.\n\nIn TRACE #2: Similar pattern with E8C8FFFF and then a different instruction sequence before C3h. \n\nTRACE #5 has an 8B4068 (mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]) followed by a call to C3h via E8F7FF. That's another potential point.\n\nI need to capture these sequences into patterns, ensuring that address bytes are replaced with ?? as per the wildcard rule.\n\nLet me try creating three distinct patterns:\n\nPattern 1: It includes the first part where E8C8FFFF is called, followed by 8B4068 and then C3h. So I can capture those instructions.\n\nPattern 2: From another trace, maybe combining E8C8FFFF with a different instruction set before C3h.\n\nPattern 3: The third trace has the same structure but with variations in the middle.\n\nWait, I need to make sure each pattern is unique and includes enough context. Also, replace all address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nSo for Pattern 0, maybe:\n\nE8C8FFFF is called (E8 followed by 4F). Then some instructions before moving to C3h via E8F7FF.\n\nWait, in TRACE #5, after E8C8FFFF comes 8B4068 and then E8F7FF. So combining these parts into a pattern could be:\n\nE8 ?? ?? F7 ??. But I need to include the full instruction sequence.\n\nAlternatively, from TRACE #1: E8C8FFFF followed by 8B4068 and then C3h via E8F7FF.\n\nSo Pattern 0 would capture E8C8FFFF, then some displacement, then mov, then E8F7FF.\n\nBut I need to structure it as a series of hex bytes with ?? where needed.\n\nSimilarly, for Pattern 1: Maybe from another trace that includes similar steps but with different instructions in between.\n\nPattern 2 could be from the third trace, which has an 8B4068 and then E8F7FF before C3h.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique, so I'll vary the order of instructions or the displacement bytes.\n\nWait, in TRACE #5, after moving with 8B4068 (dword ptr [eax+68h]), it's called via E8F7FF. So that could form a part of the pattern.\n\nI think three different patterns can be formed from these traces by capturing different instruction sequences around the evasions.\n\nSo I'll create:\n\nPattern 0: E8C8FFFF followed by mov, then E8F7FF\n\nPattern 1: Another sequence with similar structure but different intermediate steps\n\nPattern 2: From another trace's instruction set\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards appropriately.\n\nNow, I'll draft the patterns accordingly.\n</think>\n\nHere\u2019s a corrected YARA rule based on the provided traces:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ??
