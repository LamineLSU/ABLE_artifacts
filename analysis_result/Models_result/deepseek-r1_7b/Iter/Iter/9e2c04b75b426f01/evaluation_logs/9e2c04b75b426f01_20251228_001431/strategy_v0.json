Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the provided trace and feedback. The goal is to evolve from previous attempts where the rule didn't hit any new signatures. \n\nFirst, looking at the trace data, there are two exit process traces (TRACE #1 and TRACE #2) with various instructions. I need to find patterns that can be used for bypass.\n\nStrategy A suggests targeting the first 30% of the trace, specifically a call followed by test eax and je/jne. Looking at the trace, the first few lines in TRACE #1 have a call at 00B561F8 with E825050000, which is a 20-byte instruction. Then it does a test eax, then je.\n\nSo one pattern could be looking for \"call\" followed by test eax and je/jne within the first 30% of any trace.\n\nNext, Strategy B mentions checking before the exit call, but since we already covered the early call in Strategy A, maybe another approach is needed. However, since the rule didn't hit previous patterns, perhaps moving the bypass earlier or considering a different target might help.\n\nLooking at the trace again, there's a mov to 00B51140h and then a call dword ptr [00B5A12Ch]. That seems like an exit with conditional logic. Maybe using that as another pattern.\n\nFor Strategy C, which is more advanced techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID, it's less likely since the previous attempts didn't find any matches. So focusing on the first two strategies might be better.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, using exact hex values from the trace without wildcards where possible for specificity but allowing some address offsets with ?? if necessary.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll create three patterns: one targeting the early call/test/je as per Strategy A, another looking at the conditional exit in Strategy B, and a third maybe combining RDTSC timing or something else specific. Wait, but since we need to use only what's in the trace, perhaps including the mov and call as part of the pattern.\n\nSo final patterns:\n\n1. Call followed by test eax and je/jne\n2. Conditional check before exit (like conditional mov or if-then-else)\n3. Some unique instruction sequence for another bypass point\n\nI'll make sure each is 6-20 bytes, using exact hexs where possible, and wildcards for varying parts.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The original rule attempts didn't find new signatures due to matching the wrong locations. Re-focusing on specific patterns from the trace's early calls and conditional exits improves specificity.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | CONDITIONAL_EXIT_CHECK | RDTSC TIMING\n\n**REASONING**: By targeting known call sequences and conditional exit points, these patterns are more likely to bypass without matching other code paths.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 FC }  -- Targeting the early call/test/je pattern\n        $pattern1 = { E9B5FCFFFF, A18885B500, FF152CA1B500 }  -- Conditional exit check before call\n        $pattern2 = { 3D00100000000001, ??.???????+0F, ... }  -- Unique instruction sequence for timing bypass\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
