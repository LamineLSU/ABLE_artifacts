      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this malware trace data that's causing the sandbox to terminate early. The user provided five traces where ExitProcess is called at different addresses. My task is to help create a Yara rule for bypassing these evasion techniques.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how each trace works. Looking at TRACE #1 and #2, they both end with calls to some functions like E8C8FFFFFF (which seems suspicious) and then call dword ptr [00D7A12Ch] or 00A088A0h. The first three instructions after the call are E84B170000, which is a call instruction with an offset. Then there's a jmp or je instruction.\n\nIn TRACE #3 and #4, ExitProcess is called at a different address (0040E7FF), but the structure seems similar—calling some function and then jumping to another address. The last trace, TRACE #5, ends with a call to 0112E18Ch from 0112A9DC.\n\nNow, thinking about possible evasion techniques here. It looks like after calling an external function, the code jumps away using jmp or je. The attacker is probably trying to prevent static analysis by making these jumps non-trivial.\n\nFor a defender, the goal would be to find a point where the jump doesn't happen, allowing execution to continue past the bypass. So I need to identify instructions that can be skipped or modified without causing the bypass to fail.\n\nLooking at each trace:\n\n1. After the call instruction (E8C8FFFFFF), there's a jmp E80D0C0000 in TRACE #5. The attacker might have checked if EAX equals 0x24 before jumping, using jne or je. So skipping this check could bypass.\n\n2. In TRACE #1 and #2, after the call (E82CA12Ch), there's a jmp 00D76207h in the first trace and 00A05E85h in the second. The attacker might be checking if EAX equals 0x34 or another value before jumping. Skipping this instruction could bypass.\n\n3. In all traces, after the call (like E8C8FFFFFF), there's a je or jmp that checks for a condition on EAX being zero. If we can skip those instructions, execution continues past them without triggering the bypass.\n\nSo these are potential targets: the jne/je instruction right after the call and the jump based on EAX=0x34.\n\nNow, to create Yara patterns:\n\nFor each target, I need a pattern that includes the relevant instruction with wildcards for address or offset. Let's think of 6-20 bytes per pattern.\n\nPattern 1: After the call, skip the jne/je and jump. The instruction after the call is a jmp with an offset (E80D0C0000). So the pattern would be something like:\n\n[CALL opcode][JMP opcode][?4h] \n\nBut wait, in TRACE #5, it's 0112E18Ch as the target. The instruction is E80D0C0000, which is a jmp with an immediate offset of 0x00000000 (since the next bytes are ????). So the pattern would be:\n\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 0D 0C 00 00\n\nBut wait, that's only 9 bytes. Maybe we can include some context.\n\nAlternatively, for each target instruction, capture it along with surrounding instructions to make it specific.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 1 (Target: jmp after call):\nThe attacker checks if EAX != 0x34 before jumping.\nSo the pattern would be:\nE8C8FFFFFF (call) followed by jne or je and then a jump. But wait, in the trace, after the call, it's a jmp.\n\nWait, no, in the traces provided, after the call, there's either a jne or jmp without an immediate. Or perhaps I need to adjust based on the specific trace.\n\nLooking at TRACE #5: After 0112E18Ch (call), it jumps with E80D0C0000, which is 0x00000000 as a 64-bit offset. So the instruction would be:\n\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF (call) followed by E8 0D 0C 00 00\n\nBut that's only 9 bytes.\n\nSo Pattern 1 could be:\n6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 0D 0C 00 00\nWait, but where does the 6A come from? Looking at TRACE #4:\n\nAfter FFACB2h (call), it's a jmp with offset 0x13. So in that case, after the call, there's a jmp with an immediate.\n\nBut in TRACE #5, the jump is with E80D0C0000, which is a long jump with 64-bit offset.\n\nSo perhaps we can have two patterns: one for each type of jump.\n\nPattern 1 (Long jump after call):\nE8C8FFFFFF (call) followed by E8 0D 0C ?? ?\n\nWait, but in the trace it's E80D0C0000. So maybe:\n\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 0D 0C 00 00\n\nBut that's more than 20 bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to capture the call instruction and then the jump, but keep it concise.\n\nAnother approach is to take a small window around each target instruction, including any surrounding instructions necessary for the bypass.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern 1: After the call (E8C8FFFFFF), skip the jne/je by making the condition always true. So include E8C8FFFFFF followed by any possible next instructions that don't depend on EAX being zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to represent that without knowing what's after.\n\nAlternatively, capture a few bytes before and after the target instruction with wildcards for address or offset.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPattern 1:\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF (call) followed by any possible next instruction. But since we don't know, maybe include some context.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look at specific instructions that can be skipped.\n\nIn the traces, after the call, there are jmp or je instructions with conditions on EAX == 0x34.\n\nSo for each target:\n\n1. The jmp from EAX != 0x24: E8C8FFFFFF (call) followed by a jump.\n   So pattern would be:\n   FF ACB2h (call)\n   Followed by E8 C8 FFFFFFFF\n   Then the instruction after, but maybe skip that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the call and then the jump as the target.\n\nAlternatively, create patterns where the attacker checks for specific conditions before a jump. By making those jumps unconditional, we bypass them.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern 1: jmp from EAX != 0x34\nSo after the call (E8C8FFFFFF), if there's a jne or je based on EAX=0x24.\n\nTherefore, the pattern would be:\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF (call)\nFollowed by jne ?? ?? ??\nOr je ?? ?? ??\n\nBut in the trace, after the call, it's a jmp with an immediate. So maybe:\n\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF followed by E8 0D 0C ??? \n\nWait, but the offset is zero.\n\nAlternatively, I can make the pattern include the call and then a jump without any dependency on registers.\n\nSo for example, in TRACE #5:\nAfter FFACB2h (call), it's E80D0C0000 (long jmp with 64-bit offset). So the instruction is:\n\nE8 C8 FFFFFFFF followed by E8 0D 0C 00 00\n\nBut that's only 9 bytes. Maybe include more surrounding instructions to make it unique.\n\nPattern 1:\nE8 C8 FFFFFF (call)\n6A ??\n5A ?? \n8B CE\nE8 0D 0C 00 00 \n\nSo combining these:\n\nE8C8FFFFF (call) followed by any possible next instruction that could be jumped to, but specifically including E8 0D 0C 00 00.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to capture the call and then the jump as two separate instructions with wildcards on their operands.\n\nSo:\n\nPattern1:\nE8 C8 FFFFFF (call)\n6A ??\n5A ??\n8B CE\nE8 0D 0C ?? ??\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the exact offset. Maybe it's easier to include more context bytes with wildcards.\n\nAlternatively, use a shorter pattern:\n\nPattern1: E8 C8 FFFFFF followed by E8 0D 0C 00 00\n\nBut that's only 9 bytes. To make it specific, perhaps add some surrounding instructions:\n\nE8 C8 FFFFFF (call) then 6A ?? (push ebp), 5A ?? (pop edi), etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe the first pattern is just the call and the jump instruction with wildcard for offset.\n\nSo Pattern1: E8C8FFFFF followed by E80D0C??? \n\nThat's 9 bytes. Maybe that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for the second target in TRACE #1:\n\nAfter the call at E825050000 (in the first part), there's a jump to 00D76207h which is E84B170000. So perhaps Pattern2 would be that instruction and any surrounding context.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to identify each target as:\n\n- Target1: After call, jmp based on EAX=0x34 (long jump with offset 0)\n- Target2: After call, jmp based on EAX=0x24\n- Target3: After the first few instructions after the call, there's a je/jmp without checking EAX.\n\nWait, looking at TRACE #1 again:\n\nAfter the call to E82CA12Ch (E825050000), it jumps to 00D76207h. So the instruction is E84B170000.\n\nSo the pattern would be: [call] followed by [jmp E84B170000]\n\nSimilarly, in TRACE #2, after call E874FA50000, it jumps to 00A061F7h (E9B5FC0000). So another pattern.\n\nIn TRACE #3 and #4, after the call, there's a jump with an offset based on EAX=0x24 or similar.\n\nSo perhaps the three patterns are:\n\nPattern1: [call] followed by jmp 00000000 (long jump)\nPattern2: [call] followed by jmp specific address\nPattern3: [call], then a series of instructions that can be skipped\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, each target is the point where the attacker's condition is checked.\n\nSo for each trace:\n\n- The first check after call is jne/je based on EAX=0x24.\n- Another instruction after the call (like mov eax, etc.) leading to a jump with specific offset based on EAX=0x34.\n\nTherefore, three bypass points could be:\n\n1. Skip a jne or je after the call.\n2. Skip a jump from EAX != 0x34 that's after some other instructions.\n3. Skip a jmp/jne without checking EAX (like if the offset is always valid).\n\nBut I'm not certain about the exact structure.\n\nIn any case, for each bypass point, create a pattern that captures the call instruction and then the target instruction with wildcards on address/offset bytes.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n1. Target1: Call followed by jmp E84B170000 (in TRACE #1)\n   Pattern: F8 50 2A F8 CE FF 00 0D 0C ?? ??\n\nWait, perhaps better to capture the call and then the jump instruction.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPattern1:\nE8 C8 FFFFFF (call)\n6A ??\n5A ??\n8B CE\nE8 0D 0C ?? ??\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe it's better to include more surrounding instructions with wildcards.\n\nWait, another approach: capture the call and then any instruction that can be a target for bypass.\n\nFor example:\n\nPattern1:\nE8 C8 FFFFFF (call)\n5A ??\n8B CE\nE8 0D 0C ?? ??\n\nThis is 9 bytes. Maybe include more instructions around it with wildcards to make the pattern unique.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this will be specific enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each target should have a different instruction following the call where the bypass occurs.\n\nAfter considering all this, I'll proceed to create three patterns as follows:\n\nPattern1: After the call, skip a jump based on EAX=0x24. So capture the call and then the jmp with E8 0D 0C ?? ??\nPattern2: After another call, jump without condition (E8 53 ?? ?? ??.)\nPattern3: After some other instruction sequence, jump regardless of EAX.\n\nBut I'm not confident about these specifics. Maybe it's better to stick with the initial idea and create patterns that capture each target.\n</think>\n\nHere is a detailed analysis based on the provided traces:\n\n1. **Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n   - The malware author likely implemented several checks to detect sandbox evasion, such as jumping away from main code after certain conditions (e.g., `je` or `jne`) when EAX equals specific values.\n   \n2. **Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n   - **Target1**: Skipping a jump based on EAX=0x34 by making the offset always valid and removing dependency checks.\n   - **Target2**: Skipping an unconditional jump after some operations that do not check EAX, allowing execution to continue past it.\n   - **Target3**: Skipping a conditional jump when certain preconditions are not met.\n\nEach pattern is crafted to capture the specific instruction following the call where the bypass occurs, ensuring specificity while accommodating wildcards for unknown or variable offsets and addresses.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 FF7F260000FFC20 }  # After call and jump\n        $pattern1 = { 6A5A8BCE00D3FF04100D8410201000000684011D700000001040100C04100 }  # After call and jump with offset\n        $pattern2 = { 50E08BCE00D3FF04100D8410201000000684011D700000001040100C04100 }  # After call and jump with offset\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original invalid rule: it's missing the `cape_options` in the meta section and only has two patterns instead of three. The strings are also using wildcards, which is good, but there's no description or proper structure.\n\nThe user provided some valid examples for patterns, so I should model my new rule after those. Each pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes long, include opcode and registers with specific values, and use wildcards where applicable.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can see that there are three distinct points of interest: two push/pop/mov calls (targets 1 and 3) and a test instruction after a jump (target 2). \n\nFor target 1, in the first trace, the pattern is 85 C0 followed by four wildcards and then 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45. So I can use that as my first pattern.\n\nFor target 2, which is a jump instruction (E8 with an offset), I need to include more surrounding context. Maybe something like E8 followed by five wildcards and the operands after.\n\nFor target 3, it's another push instruction. Looking at the third trace, the pattern is similar but slightly different: maybe starting with 6A ?? 5A ... instead of 85 C0.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique and meets the length requirement. Also, I'll add a description for clarity and include the `cape_options` as specified.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting three distinct paths\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help correct the Yara rule based on the provided analysis. The user has given a previous incorrect rule and the necessary validation errors. My task is to generate a new corrected rule that follows all the requirements.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: the original rule was missing the `cape_options` in meta and had only one pattern instead of three. So, I need to ensure that each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards where necessary, and includes three distinct patterns from the provided traces.\n\nLooking at the trace data, I can see various instructions like `85 C0`, `6A ??`, etc. I'll select three different instruction sequences, ensuring each is around 10-15 bytes to meet the length requirement.\n\nI should also replace all address or offset bytes with `??` and keep opcode and register bytes concrete. Each pattern will be combined from consecutive instructions, including context like surrounding bytes after jumps.\n\nNow, I'll construct three patterns based on different instruction sequences in the traces, ensuring they are distinct and cover various points of interest.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting stack pushes and pops\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
