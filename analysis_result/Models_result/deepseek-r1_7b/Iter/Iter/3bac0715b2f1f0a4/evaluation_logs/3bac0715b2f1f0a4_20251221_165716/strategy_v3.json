(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to fix this Yara rule correction issue. The user mentioned that their previous attempt failed validation because their patterns were too short\u2014each needed to be at least 6 bytes long. They provided some trace data and outlined what the valid patterns should look like.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the problem lies. Each of the original patterns was only a few bytes, which is way below the required minimum of 6. The solution is to combine more instructions into each pattern, ensuring they meet the length requirement while still being specific enough to match their intended locations in the trace.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I see sequences like mov instructions followed by push or conditional jumps. These could be good candidates for creating bypass patterns because they represent points where evasion can occur.\n\nI'll start by selecting three distinct parts of the trace that represent different types of checks. Each part should include enough context to make the pattern specific without being too long. For each selected part, I'll need to replace any address or offset bytes with '??' to keep them wildcarded, as per Yara's rules.\n\nFor example, in the first section, there's a mov instruction followed by some pushes and conditionals. Combining these into one pattern might work well because it represents a sequence of operations that could be bypassed together. I'll make sure each part is at least 6 bytes long and includes enough surrounding instructions to avoid false positives.\n\nI also need to ensure that each pattern is unique, so they don't overlap with others. This way, the Yara rule can correctly identify which bypass has been applied without affecting legitimate code execution elsewhere in the process.\n\nOnce I have these three patterns ready, I'll format them according to Yara's syntax\u2014each within curly braces and separated by spaces. Then, I'll include the cape_options section pointing to these new patterns with action set to skip each one when detected.\n\nFinally, I'll review everything to make sure there are no syntax errors, like missing braces or incorrect use of wildcards, ensuring that all address bytes are properly replaced with '??'. This should resolve the validation issues and provide a correct bypass rule for evasion.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
