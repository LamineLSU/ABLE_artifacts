(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help create a Yara rule based on the provided malware trace that's evading detection in a sandbox or VM. The goal is to find three bypass patterns that can detect when an attacker is attempting to evade analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the trace data and where the evasion checks might be implemented. Looking at the trace, there are several calls and jumps that could indicate checks for sandbox evasion like checking stack addresses, memory access, or instruction flow.\n\nI notice a lot of calls to dword ptr [006150A4h], which is an unusual address since it's inside the same process if the code is being analyzed. This might be a sign that the attacker wants to avoid detection by changing where they call instructions.\n\nNow, looking for potential bypass points:\n\n1. **Check 1**: There are multiple calls and jumps. The instruction 0060B182 is FF15A4506100 which is a call to dword ptr [006150A4h]. If this address isn't checked, the attacker can bypass any stack checks here.\n\n2. **Check 2**: Earlier in the trace, there are calls like E88D9AFFFF (call 00604730h). The attacker might be trying to bypass a specific memory check at that offset by changing the instruction slightly or skipping it entirely.\n\n3. **Check 3**: There's a call to EBCD which jumps back to another part of the code, possibly creating a loop or an unexpected execution path that can be exploited without being detected.\n\nNow, I'll create patterns for each bypass point:\n\nFor the first pattern, if the attacker skips instruction 0060B182 (call dword ptr [006150A4h]), it would cause a bypass. So combining this with nearby instructions and applying wildcards where applicable.\n\nPattern 1: The call to 006150A4h is at the end of instruction 0060B182, so skipping that would bypass the check. Combining previous instructions like E8BC (mov ebp, [ebp-3Ch]) and 0060B182.\n\nPattern 2: The call to 006150F0h at instruction 0060B133 might be a memory check. Bypassing this by skipping the instruction would help.\n\nPattern 3: The EBCD jump (instruction 0060B14B) could create an unexpected loop, allowing bypass without usual checks. Skipping that instruction would be another way to bypass.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes and includes the target instruction with surrounding context, replacing address/offset bytes with ?? as per wildcard rules.\n</think>\n\nHere's a Yara rule based on the analysis:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection using multiple patterns\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45E4 ?? ?? ?? ??

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and feedback. The current best rule didn't match any new signatures, so I need to come up with some effective patterns that can catch bypass attempts.\n\nFirst, looking at Strategy A: it's about checking for a call followed by a test on EAX with a JE or JNE instruction before an exit. In the trace provided, there are multiple calls and tests. For example, lines like 0060B104 FF159C506100 (call dword ptr) followed by movs and other operations.\n\nI should look for a pattern where a call is made to a test function, then an instruction that jumps conditionally based on EAX. Maybe something like:\n\n- Call to a specific address\n- Then a series of mov instructions\n- Followed by a conditional jump (JE/JNE) with specific operands\n\nLooking at the trace, after calls there are movs like 8B45C4 which is mov eax, dword ptr..., then EAX might be used in a comparison. So maybe:\n\nCall to 0060B103\nThen some mov instructions (like 8B45C4 and 8B55C4)\nThen a conditional jump like JE or JNE with specific operands.\n\nBut since the exact bytes are needed, I'll have to pick from what's available in the trace. Alternatively, maybe focusing on the function that checks EAX before exiting could be effective.\n\nFor Strategy B: This is about checking if there's a conditional check before the exit call. Maybe looking for a cmp instruction followed by a conditional jump or a JE/JNE with specific values.\n\nAnother approach is to look at where the exit happens and see if there's a decision point before it that can be bypassed, like a conditional move or a conditional jump based on EAX/Ecx.\n\nSince each pattern must come from the original trace, I need to pick exact hex sequences. For example, lines with 8B45C4 are mov eax, dword ptr..., so maybe combining those with test instructions before could form a bypassable path.\n\nI should also consider if any of these patterns have address wildcards (??) for offset bytes since they can vary. This would make the pattern more specific and reduce false positives.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll try to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns that target different parts of the trace where a bypass could occur.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts didn't find new signatures because the bypass was likely occurring at similar instruction sequences. By focusing on specific conditional checks and function calls before exit points, we can create more targeted patterns to bypass.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK, CMP_SETZ\n\n**REASONING**: \n- **CALL_TEST_JE**: This pattern targets a common method where a test is performed after a call. By matching this sequence with specific addresses and instructions, the rule can identify bypass attempts that avoid exit checks.\n- **API_CHECK**: This looks for calls to API functions followed by conditional jumps, which are often used in evasion tactics.\n- **CMP_SETZ**: This pattern targets comparisons before exits, which are common points where bypass is attempted.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - target conditional checks before exit\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45C4 FF159C506100 E85F880000       } -- mov eax, dword ptr... followed by call dword ptr...\n        $pattern1 = { 83E800 8B4D80 C745C4 F88D9AFFFF } -- conditional move and jump\n        $pattern2 = { 83F600 FF15E4 FF15FC           } -- compare and jump based on EAX value\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

I can combine these into three distinct patterns.\n\nFor $pattern0, maybe a call followed by some context. For $pattern1, a conditional jump with displacement. And for $pattern2, another unique sequence that's not too similar to the others.\n\nI'll ensure each pattern has wildcards where needed and that they're all different from each other. Also, I'll add the necessary meta information like description and cape_options.\n\nFinally, I'll format them correctly with spaces between bytes and wrap each in { }. \n\nLet me draft each pattern based on the trace data examples provided.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting call, conditional jumps, and memory accesses\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? ???? 0C ????.??.}\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
