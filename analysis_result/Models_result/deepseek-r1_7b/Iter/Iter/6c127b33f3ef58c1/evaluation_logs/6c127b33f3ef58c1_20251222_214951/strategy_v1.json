Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user generate an improved YARA bypass rule based on their provided trace data and previous attempts. The goal is to create a rule that successfully evades detection with higher confidence. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the user's history, they've tried several strategies without success. Their latest attempt resulted in no new signatures, so I need to refine their approach.\n\nThe task context mentions trying two traces where ExitProcess was called at 0041B93C twice. The original trace has a series of instructions that call functions and manipulate registers before exiting. My job is to find patterns within this trace that can be used as bypass points.\n\nFrom the principles provided, three strategies are considered: Evasion Check (60% success), Exit Decision (25%), and Eviction Techniques (15%). Since previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, I should focus on where the exit is decided rather than just checking or evicting.\n\nLooking at Strategy A, it's about the first 30% of the trace. That would be around the beginning of each call. The pattern here involves a test and a jump instruction (JE/JNE). Maybe looking for something like testing EAX and jumping based on its value could work.\n\nStrategy B suggests targeting the exit decision before the actual exit call. This might involve finding conditional checks just before ExitProcess or similar functions are called. Since the trace shows calls to 0041DF02h (E9 in hex) twice, which is likely a custom function, I should check if there's any conditional logic around that.\n\nStrategy C involves unique techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID VM detection, but since the user hasn't tried these yet and previous attempts didn't yield results, maybe focusing on A and B would be better.\n\nNow, analyzing the provided trace:\n\nLooking at the first few instructions:\n- They call E9 (0041DF02h) twice.\n- After that, there's a test on AL with 01h and a conditional jump if not equal.\n- Then, they manipulate EAX by moving from a stack offset to another.\n\nPossible bypass points could be right after the E9 calls but before the test. Maybe inserting a skip instruction would help bypass these checks.\n\nAnother point is around the call to 0042F13Ch and 0042F140h, which are likely API functions. If there's any conditional logic in those calls (like checking AL), that could be another bypass target.\n\nI should extract specific sequences from the trace. For example:\n1. Right after E9 is called, before the test on AL.\n2. Before the conditionals around the API calls.\n3. Maybe right at the point where EAX is moved but not yet checked.\n\nEach of these points could be a potential bypass target. I'll need to create patterns that match these sequences with wildcards for varying offsets and specific instructions.\n\nLet me draft some possible patterns:\n\n1. After E9, the test AL 01h followed by JE/JNE.\n   - Pattern: [E9] 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8\n     (This is a specific sequence matching the trace exactly.)\n\n2. Before the conditionals in the API calls, perhaps right after moving EAX from a stack offset.\n   - Pattern: 64 A1 30 00 ?? 8B 45 FC\n     (Moving EAX to an unknown offset but checking AL.)\n\n3. Another point could be at the call to 0042F1A0h, where there's a test on EAX.\n   - Pattern: FF 15 A0 F1 42 ?? 8B 75 08\n     (This is after the call and involves a test on EAX.)\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the trace. Also, including wildcards where offsets vary will help avoid false matches.\n\nFinally, I'll structure these patterns into the YARA rule with appropriate meta descriptions and strings.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:**  \nThe previous attempts focused on specific strategies without considering the exact points where program termination occurs. By analyzing the provided trace, we identified potential bypass opportunities right before conditional checks that determine program exit. These new patterns target these decision points to effectively evade detection.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:**  \n- **CALL_TEST_JE (Pattern 1)**: Targets a test on EAX followed by JE/JNE.\n- **API_CHECK (Pattern 2)**: Focuses on potential conditional logic before API calls.\n- **TEST_EAX (Pattern 3)**: Focuses on a test on EAX right before an exit decision.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:**  \n90\n\n**REASONING:**  \nThese patterns are specific enough to hit the intended target points in the trace but general enough to accommodate variants. By focusing on the exact sequences where program termination decisions occur, we increase the likelihood of bypass success while minimizing false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**  \n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting decision points before exit\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- Test EAX and jump based on result\n        $pattern1 = { 64 A1 30 00 ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- Potential conditional after API call arguments\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 A0 F1 42 ?? 8B 75 08 }  -- Check EAX before exit decision\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and previous attempts. The goal is to target specific points where the malware might be trying to exit or make decisions without being detected.\n\nFirst, looking at the original trace, there are two identical traces with the same steps. Both end with a call to ExitProcess at 0041B93C. Since the last attempt hit a rule but didn't find new signatures, it's likely that the bypass was applied too late or not early enough in the trace.\n\nThe key is to identify where the decision points are before the exit. Strategy A suggests looking at the first 30% of the trace for calls followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. Let me check if there's a call, then a TEST EAX instruction somewhere around line 6-15 (since each line represents about 20 instructions).\n\nLooking through the trace:\n\nAt line 0041B901: The code starts with a push ebp, then mov edi, edi. Then it calls DF02h at 0041B906. After that, there's a cmp eax, 01h on line 0041B90E.\n\nWait, so after the call to DF02h, there's a test al, 01h (or cmp). So maybe this is where the check happens before exiting.\n\nAnother point could be earlier in the trace. Let me see if any calls are followed by TEST EAX or something similar.\n\nLooking at line 0041B906: The first call after moving edi to esp is DF02h, then test al, 01h on line 0041B90E. So this could be a candidate for Strategy A.\n\nAlso, looking further in the trace, there's another call at 0041B930 which leads to the ExitProcess. But that's after other calls and operations, so maybe not as good for bypassing.\n\nAnother thought: The code has some conditional jumps or checks before exiting. For example, if al is not zero (jne), it would jump ahead. So perhaps using a condition like TEST EAX, JNE before the exit could be effective.\n\nSo combining these observations, I'll create three patterns:\n\n1. A call to DF02h followed by TEST EAX and JNE.\n2. Another specific instruction sequence related to conditional checks.\n3. A timing or CPUID check if needed.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes long, uses exact hex from the trace where possible, and includes wildcards for varying parts like offsets.\n\nLet me draft these patterns based on the trace data provided.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous approach didn't find new signatures despite a rule hit. This suggests that the bypass was applied too late or not early enough in the trace. By focusing on earlier decision points, such as conditional checks before the exit call, we can create more effective bypass patterns.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: The first occurrence of a call followed by TEST EAX and JNE provides an early decision point for bypassing. This increases the likelihood of evading detection without being applied too late in the process.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with earlier decision points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45FC ?? ?? ?? ?? 7412 }\n        $pattern1 = { C1E808 ?? ?? ?? ?? 7510 }\n        $pattern2 = { E8F7250000 ??
