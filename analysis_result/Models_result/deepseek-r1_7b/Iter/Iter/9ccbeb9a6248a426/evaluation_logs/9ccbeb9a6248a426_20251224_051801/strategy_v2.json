Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help create a YARA bypass rule based on the given trace and some previous attempts. The goal is to find a way to bypass the malware by targeting certain instructions that are likely used in exit or terminate processes.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided trace data for TRACE #1 and TRACE #2, there's a lot of x86 instructions. I notice several places where there are TEST EAX, JE/JNE jumps, and calls to functions like ExitProcess. The idea is to find a bypass pattern that can skip these checks.\n\nFrom the user's history, they tried some strategies but didn't get new signatures, which suggests their previous patterns matched too broadly or at the wrong place. So I need to be more specific.\n\nThe key here is to target specific instruction sequences early in the trace before any actual processing happens. The user mentioned strategies A, B, and C. Strategy A was about checking for a call followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE. Strategy B looks at the exit decision before the call. Strategy C uses timing or unique instructions like RDTSC.\n\nSince the previous attempts didn't find new signatures, maybe they used too broad of a pattern or matched in the wrong place. So I should focus on earlier parts of the trace where certain instruction sequences could be bypassed more effectively.\n\nLooking at the provided trace, I see several instances of 85 C0 followed by TEST EAX and then JE/JNE jumps. These seem like good candidates for Strategy A because they target the check before any real processing occurs.\n\nSo I can create three patterns based on these sequences:\n\n1. The first pattern starts with 85C0, which is a common test instruction used in bypass attempts. It's followed by TEST EAX and then a JE/JNE jump to some offset. This sequence is likely targeting an exit or decision point.\n2. The second pattern also uses 85C0 but targets a different section of the code where the behavior might be slightly different, such as with different operands in the JE instruction.\n3. The third pattern again starts with 85C0 but has different offsets after the TEST EAX and JE instructions, making it more specific to certain exit conditions.\n\nBy using these three patterns, each targeting a different section of the code early on, I can increase the chances that one of them will find an effective bypass without matching too broadly. This should help in creating a YARA rule that's more precise and has a higher confidence level.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempts didn't yield new signatures, suggesting broader or incorrect patterns matched. By focusing on specific instruction sequences early in the trace (Strategy A), we can target bypass points before actual processing begins.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE for each pattern targeting different early exit checks.\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns are designed to hit specific TEST EAX followed by JE/JNE jumps, likely targeting exit decision points without broad matching issues.\n\n---\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Bypass evasion using specific early exit checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [85C0 0F84 7412 6A5B] }\n        $pattern1 = { [85C0 0F84 7413 6A5B] }\n        $pattern2 = { [85C0 0F84 7414 6A5B] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**YARA_RULE** with specific instruction sequences to bypass early exit checks in the code.",
