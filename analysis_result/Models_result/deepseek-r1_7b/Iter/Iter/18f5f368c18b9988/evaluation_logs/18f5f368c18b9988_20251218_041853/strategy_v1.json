and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm new to creating YARA rules, so I'll need to go through each part carefully.\n\nFirst, the user provided a previous invalid attempt at a YARA rule for bypass detection and wants it corrected based on validation errors. The main issues were missing basic structure (rule name, strings, condition) and needing three different patterns with wildcards.\n\nLooking at the valid reasoning strategy, I see that they want exactly three different patterns derived from the provided trace data. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\nThe trace data shows several function calls and jumps. The exit path is triggered by a call to ExitProcess@KERNEL32.DLL at address 00231112 with an argument of E9FFFFFFFFFF. \n\nI need to extract three distinct sequences from the trace that could potentially bypass the sandbox.\n\nLet's identify possible patterns:\n\n1. **The first pattern** might be around the call to ExitProcess and its preceding instructions. Looking at the address 00231111, which is a call instruction (E9). The next instruction is F8, which tests EAX. So combining these with wildcards for any offset bytes:\n\n   ```\n   $pattern0 = { 5F 8C ?? ?? ?? ?? FF 47 }\n   ```\n\n2. **The second pattern** could be the call to ExitProcess and the following ret instruction (C3). This would involve the E9, F8, TEST EAX, and the ret:\n\n   ```\n   $pattern1 = { E9 F8 ?? ?? ?? C3 FF 47 }\n   ```\n\nWait, but I need to ensure each pattern is exactly from the trace data. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking again at the trace, after the call to ExitProcess (E9), it returns with a specific argument and then rets back. Another possible bypass could be in the earlier calls, like the call from F8 or others.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the first few instructions:\n\n- At address 002310A7, there's a push operation (56) followed by a mov instruction (6A). Then at 002310AA, a call to dword ptr [00260088h], which is VirtualAlloc@KERNEL32.DLL.\n\n   So combining these:\n\n   ```\n   $pattern1 = { 56 push, 6A push, E8 (call), ?? ... }\n   ```\n\nBut I need exact hex values. Let me parse the instructions more carefully.\n\nAt address 002310A7: 56 is push ebx.\nThen at 002310AA: call dword ptr [00260088h] (VirtualAlloc).\n\nSo combining these with the surrounding bytes:\n\n- The instruction before the call is E8, but looking back, it's a call instruction. So maybe the pattern includes the push and the call.\n\n   ```\n   $pattern1 = { 56 6A ?? ... }\n   ```\n\nBut I need to include more bytes for specificity.\n\nAnother approach: focusing on the function calls that could be bypassed.\n\nLooking at address 002310B5 (8BC0): cld, then 50 push eax. Then 83F811: cmp eax, 11h. So this is a conditional jump based on eax value.\n\nA possible pattern here:\n\n```\n$pattern1 = { 6C ?? ... }\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nLet me try to find three distinct sequences from the trace data.\n\nFirst sequence: The call at address 00231111 (E9) followed by F8 and then some bytes. So:\n\n- E9 (call)\n- F8 (TEST EAX)\n- Maybe FF47 (ret)\n\nBut I need to include surrounding instructions for wildcards.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to look at the call instruction's address. The argument passed is 0xEFFFFFFFFFFF, which is a displacement of 0xFFFFFFF. So perhaps the pattern includes that:\n\n```\n$pattern0 = { E9 F8 ?? ... FF }\n```\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe it's better to pick three distinct instructions from the trace and create patterns based on them.\n\n1. The first call: at address 00231111, which is E9 followed by a displacement of EFFFFFFFFFFF.\n   So:\n   ```\n   $pattern0 = { E9 ?? F8 FF 47 }\n   ```\n\nWait, I'm not getting the exact bytes.\n\nAnother idea: Each pattern should consist of two consecutive instructions. Let's see:\n\n- At address 002310A5 (6A), push and then another instruction.\n- Then at 002310B4 (8B), pop and maybe some movement.\n\nSo combining these, perhaps the first pattern is:\n\n```\n$pattern0 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ... }\n```\n\nBut I'm not certain.\n\nI think it's better to create three different patterns by selecting different instruction sequences from the trace. Each must be 6-20 bytes long, using wildcards where applicable.\n\nLet me attempt:\n\n1. Pattern for the first bypass scenario:\n   ```\n   $pattern0 = { E9 F8 ?? FF C3 }\n   ```\n\nBut I need to include more bytes and ensure they're from the trace.\n\nWait, another approach: extract three different instruction sequences that could potentially be exploited.\n\nFirst sequence (from address 0x1234567A):\n- 5F (pop)\n- 8C (inc)\n- ?? ... \n\nSecond sequence:\n- E9 (call) followed by F8 and some displacement.\n\nThird sequence:\n- 6A (push), then 5A, etc.\n\nI think I need to be more precise. Let me list out the relevant instructions with their hex values:\n\nLooking at address 0x23110000: push operation is 56, followed by another push at 5A.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for specific sequences in the trace.\n\nAfter analyzing, I think three distinct patterns can be formed as follows:\n\n1. The call instruction (E9) with a displacement of EFFFFFFFFFFF.\n2. A conditional jump near and some operations leading up to it.\n3. Another sequence involving pushes and pops around the address 0x8B45.\n\nSo, here are my final three patterns with wildcards:\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E9 0F FF ?? ??

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user correct their Yara rule based on the provided information. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: the main issue is missing basic structure\u2014specifically, the rule is missing strings and condition parts. The user mentioned they have three patterns but didn't include them in the meta section under 'strings' or set a condition.\n\nThe user provided the trace data which includes various instructions like JE, JZ, TEST, CALL, and ExitProcess. They also listed the exit path backwards to identify bypass candidates: the call dword ptr [0026003Ch] (B), then before that, 8BC0 mov eax, eax (A), and FF154C002600 call dword ptr [0026003Ch] (D). \n\nI need to extract three distinct patterns from these instructions. Let's consider each instruction and their surrounding context to form the patterns.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n- At address 0023110C, there's a TEST EAX instruction before a JZ.\n- Before that, an E8 push with some displacement bytes.\n- Another TEST EAX followed by a JZ before another call.\n\nSo possible patterns could be:\n1. TEST EAX (65) followed by JZ (74) and some displacement.\n2. E8 with specific offsets for the push.\n3. A different instruction sequence, perhaps a conditional jump with a test.\n\nI'll replace address bytes with ?? as per wildcard rules. Each pattern should be 6-20 bytes long. For example:\n1. TEST EAX + JZ (74) + displacement and another instruction.\n2. E8 push with specific offset.\n3. Another unique sequence, maybe a conditional jump.\n\nI also need to include the 'cape_options' in the meta section, referencing each pattern correctly as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2 with action0, etc., all set to skip and count 0 since it's a bypass rule.\n\nFinally, ensuring that all patterns are unique and exactly three are present without any duplicates. This should fix the structure issues mentioned in the error.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 74 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 65 74 ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
