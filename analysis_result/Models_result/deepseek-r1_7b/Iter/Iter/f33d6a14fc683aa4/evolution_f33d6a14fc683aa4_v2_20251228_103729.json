      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to analyze this Yara analysis where the trace data shows the program exiting before it should, indicating some kind of malware evasion. The user wants me to create a bypass rule using three different patterns that could cause the exit without executing the necessary code.\n\nFirst, looking at the traces, especially TRACE #1 and #2, I see a lot of similar instructions leading up to ExitProcess. Both have a call to 00A36CE0h and then 00A3A12Ch. These seem like they're part of the legitimate code flow, but in this case, they lead to an early exit.\n\nThen there's TRACE #3, #4, which also has similar calls leading to ExitProcess. And TRACE #5 is a bit different with more jumps and a call to 010CE18Ch instead.\n\nI think the idea here is that these exit calls are bypassed by skipping certain instructions before them. So, if I can find sequences where those exit calls are not preceded by their normal setup code, it could indicate an evasion.\n\nLooking at each trace:\n\nTRACE #1: The exit call happens after a series of push and pop operations. If any of these were skipped, the program would jump to the exit earlier.\n\nTRACE #2: Similar structure but with slightly different jumps. Again, skipping certain instructions here might bypass the setup before the exit.\n\nTRACE #3-4: These have FF7508 pushes, which are common in x86 for setting up stack offsets. If these were skipped, the program would jump directly to the call at 0041B0ACh, thus exiting early.\n\nTRACE #5: This has more complex jumps with conditional moves and different calls. Skipping some of these could lead to an exit without going through normal code paths.\n\nSo, for each pattern, I need to create a sequence where either:\n\n- The setup before the exit call is skipped (like skipping push/pop or not performing certain operations).\n- The conditions that would normally require execution are bypassed, so the jump happens regardless of the flags.\n- Or any address/offsets are replaced with wildcards to make the pattern match more possibilities.\n\nI have to ensure each pattern is unique and covers different parts of the code. Also, each pattern should be between 6-20 bytes long, combining multiple instructions into a single pattern.\n\nFor example, for the first pattern, maybe skipping the push operations before the exit call. Then in the second, perhaps skipping some conditional jumps that normally lead to the setup. The third could involve bypassing the stack pushes entirely.\n\nI need to write each pattern with wildcards where applicable and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete. Also, make sure there's enough context after the call so it doesn't match other code.\n\nAlright, I think I have a rough idea on how to structure these patterns by looking at which parts can be skipped or modified without affecting the exit but bypassing the necessary steps.\n</think>\n\nTo create effective Yara rules for detecting potential malware evasion through bypass, we analyze the provided traces and identify sequences where legitimate instructions could be skipped. These skips lead to an early program exit (ExitProcess). We'll craft three distinct patterns targeting different parts of the code flow.\n\n### 1. Bypassing Setup Before ExitProcess in TRACE #1\nThis pattern targets a scenario where the stack pushes (EBP manipulation) before the legitimate setup for ExitProcess are bypassed, leading to an early jump to the exit instruction.\n```yara\nrule ExitProcess_Skipped_Setup\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass by skipping pre-existing stack setup\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF75 08 FF75 08 FF15 AC B0 41 00 FF15 2C 6E ???? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Evasion in TRACE #3-4 by Skipping Stack Setup\nThis pattern bypasses the stack pushes (FF7508) that are typically required to set up the stack pointer before the ExitProcess call, allowing an early exit.\n```yara\nrule Skip_Stack_Setup\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion by bypassing stack setup for ExitProcess\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B FF ?? ???? 55 8B EC E8 C8 FF FF 8C4B ??? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF75 08 ?? ???? 8B 4E 04 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF75 08 ?? ???? FF15 AC B0 41 00 FF15 2C ??? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### 3. bypassing Conditional Jumps in TRACE #5\nThis pattern targets scenarios where conditional jumps that normally lead to the legitimate code path before ExitProcess are bypassed, leading directly to the exit instruction.\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Conditional_Jump\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion by bypassing conditional jump instructions\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B FF ?? ???? 55 8B EC E8 C8 FF FF 8C4B ??? }\n        $pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 ???? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF75 08 ?? ???? 8B 4E 04 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nEach rule is designed to match specific sequences where bypass operations could lead to an early exit, helping detect potential evasion techniques.",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the original task and the previous attempt, the user had a rule with three patterns but it didn't meet all the requirements. The validation errors pointed out that the rule was missing some key elements like the meta description, correct syntax, and proper use of wildcards and opcode bytes.\n\nThe main goal is to create a corrected Yara rule with exactly three patterns, each 6-20 bytes long. Each pattern must include wildcards for address/offsets and keep opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I can identify specific instruction sequences that might be used by the malware to bypass detection. For example, the first trace shows a sequence starting with TEST EAX followed by JZ with an offset. This could be one pattern: 85 C0 (TEST), then 7412 (JZ), and maybe some nearby instructions.\n\nAnother potential pattern is a call instruction with specific offsets. The second trace has a call to a dword ptr, so I can include that as another pattern, using wildcards for the displacement.\n\nThe third pattern might involve a series of operations leading up to a call, like push, pop, mov, and then call. This would require combining multiple instructions into one pattern with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes. For example, combining TEST EAX, JZ offset, and the next instruction gives me a manageable length. Similarly, including the call instruction with its displacement works as another pattern.\n\nAlso, I must include the correct CAPE options in the meta description, specifying that each pattern skips the specified action (which is 'skip' for bypass). The strings should be wrapped correctly and use $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the rule with the proper syntax, ensuring braces around the hex patterns and spaces between bytes. Each pattern will be a combination of instructions from the trace, using wildcards where address/offsets are present.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass detection (Test EAX JZ with offset)\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 7412 ?? ?? ???? 0F84 F8C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 03 C3 F8C0 0000 0000 0000 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A5B 5A ?? 8BCE E825 ?? 0000 0000 0001 0000 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the original problem is.\n\nThe user provided a previous incorrect attempt at generating a YARA rule and the corresponding validation errors. The main issues were that the rule didn't meet all the requirements: it was missing the 'count=0' field, had only one pattern instead of three, and didn't include the required wildcard bytes for address offsets. \n\nLooking at the valid examples provided in the reasoning strategy, I see that each pattern is created by combining multiple instructions into a single hex string, with wildcards (??) replacing any address or offset bytes. Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long.\n\nIn the previous rule, there was only one pattern ($pattern0), and no wildcard usage except for the last byte of $pattern0. The strings were not properly formatted in braces either.\n\nTo fix this, I'll need to create three distinct patterns based on the provided trace data. Each pattern should be exactly 6-20 bytes long. Additionally, any address or offset bytes must be replaced with ??.\n\nLooking at the trace data for TRACE #1 and #2, both have similar instruction sequences involving E8 calls followed by conditional jumps (74/75). Also, in the strings section of the corrected example, there are three patterns:\n\n$pattern0: Combines 8B C0 and other nearby instructions with wildcards.\n\n$pattern1: Another combination from a different part of the trace.\n\n$pattern2: A third distinct pattern again from another section.\n\nEach pattern should have enough context to ensure specificity. I'll make sure each has at least six bytes, uses ?? for any address/offsets, and keeps opcode and register-encoding concrete.\n\nNow, applying these considerations, I can draft three unique patterns that match the evasion techniques observed in the traces.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific CALL/JMP sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B C0 FF ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 5F ?? ?F 73 ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 75 ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
