        "prompt_tokens": 2086,
        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help correct this Yara rule based on the given task and the previous attempt. Let me start by understanding what's wrong with the original rule.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: there's a missing basic structure\u2014no rule name, strings, or condition. The strings section is incomplete because only $pattern0 is defined, not $pattern1 and $pattern2. Also, the meta section is missing the description and cape_options.\n\nThe task requires exactly three patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2), each 6-20 bytes long with wildcards for addresses/offsets. The example given uses TEST EAX + JZ + MOV, which is an 11-byte pattern.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I need to extract three distinct patterns from the instructions around where the evasions occur. Each pattern should target a specific instruction or a group of consecutive instructions that include addresses or offsets with wildcards.\n\nLet me analyze the first trace:\n\n- The call sequence includes E8 followed by 0x7508, then calls dword ptr [0042F13Ch], which is $pattern0.\n- Then FF153CF14200 calls dword ptr [0042F140h] in $pattern1.\n- And another call to [0042F1A0h] in $pattern2.\n\nWait, but the patterns should be 6-20 bytes. I need to combine multiple instructions into a single pattern. For example, combining the E8 instruction with the next few bytes as context.\n\nFor $pattern0: The call instruction is E8 followed by 7508 (hex) and then the target address. So maybe E8 + the offset bytes as wildcards.\n\n$pattern0 could be something like E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, since the offset after E8 is variable.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1: After FF153CF14200, it calls 0042F140h. So maybe FF followed by 15, 3C, F1, 42, and then ?? for the displacement.\n\nWait, no\u2014FF is part of the opcode (call instruction), so it should be kept concrete. Then the operands are ??.\n\nBut I need to make sure each pattern has at least 6 bytes. Let me think:\n\n- $pattern0: E8 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ?? -> But wait, that's only 7 bytes. Or maybe include more context like before and after.\n\nWait, looking at the instructions in the trace:\n\nFor example, in the first call:\nE8F7250000 (which is probably a mov instruction) followed by E8 push... Then E8 7508 ... etc.\n\nSo perhaps $pattern0 can be: E8 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? because after E8, it's FF7508 as the offset. But wait, E8 is part of the call instruction, so maybe not including the previous mov or push? Hmm, this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pattern should consist of a specific instruction and its operands with wildcards where needed.\n\nLet me try to define:\n\n$pattern0: The first call after E8F7250000 is FF7508 pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So the $pattern0 could be FF 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ??, but that's only 7 bytes. Maybe need to include more context.\n\nWait, no\u2014each pattern should target a specific point, so perhaps each is an instruction and its operands with wildcards where applicable.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the good example given: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? which is 11 bytes. So I need to create similar patterns but using the trace data.\n\nWait, perhaps $pattern0 is from E8 push dword ptr [ebp+08h], so that's 7 bytes: E8 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ??. But let me check:\n\nIn the first call after E8F7250000, it's E8 FF7508 push. So maybe $pattern0 is FF7508 followed by displacement as wildcards.\n\nWait, perhaps better to think of each pattern as a specific instruction and its operands with enough context bytes before or after, including any possible wildcards for addresses.\n\nAlternatively, let me try extracting three different patterns from the trace:\n\n1. The first call: E8 FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So maybe $pattern0 is FF 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes if we have FF followed by 75, 08 and four wildcards? No, wait:\n\nWait, the call instruction after E8F7250000 is FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So the opcode is FF (push), then 7508 as operands. But in Yara, each byte represents a hex value.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be something like FF 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is 7 bytes.\n\n2. The second call: FF153CF14200 followed by push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So maybe $pattern1 starts with FF, then the next few bytes as operands and wildcards.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure each pattern is unique and captures a specific instruction sequence. Maybe:\n\n$pattern1: FF 15 3C F1 42 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut that's speculative; perhaps more precise.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the second call in $pattern0 as FF7508 followed by push, maybe $pattern0 is FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ?? which includes the displacement and wildcards for any possible offset.\n\nSimilarly, for $pattern1: After E8F7250000 comes another mov instruction, then a call. Maybe that's where the second pattern starts.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline each pattern based on the trace:\n\nPattern 0:\n- The first call after E8F7250000 is FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So the instruction is FF (push) followed by 7508, then ?? for displacement.\n\nSo $pattern0 could be: FF 75 08 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes if we include FF and four wildcards after. Wait:\n\nWait, FF is one byte, 75 is the next, 08 third, then maybe two more operands (displacement) as ?? ??.\n\nSo $pattern0: FF 75 08 ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's only 6 bytes.\n\nPattern 1:\nThe second call is FF153CF14200 followed by push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. So the instruction is FF, then next byte is 15, then 3C, F1, 42. Then displacement as ??.\n\nSo $pattern1: FF 15 3C F1 42 ?? ??\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes again (FF + five operands). Wait:\n\nNo, each Yara hex string is a sequence of bytes separated by spaces. So if I have FF followed by 15, 3C, etc., then the displacement as wildcards.\n\nWait, perhaps $pattern1: FF 15 3C F1 42 ?? ??\n\nBut that's only six bytes (including FF and five operands). Maybe adding another wildcard for more context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include more instructions before or after to make each pattern unique.\n\nPattern 2:\nThe third call is FF15A0 ?? [ebp+...] So perhaps $pattern2 starts with FF followed by displacement as wildcards.\n\nSo $pattern2: FF ???? ?\n\nBut that might be too vague. Alternatively, combining the first mov instruction before the calls to capture a broader context.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the example given in the task, which uses TEST EAX + JZ + MOV, perhaps each pattern is an instruction sequence with operands.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each call as part of a broader instruction set that includes the context. For example:\n\nPattern 0 could be: E8 FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] => so E8 followed by FF, then 75, etc., and wildcards for any displacement.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to structure each pattern as a specific instruction plus its operands with wildcards where necessary.\n\nI think I need to define three distinct patterns from the trace data, ensuring that each is 6-20 bytes long, uses wildcards for address/offsets, and keeps opcodes concrete.\n\nLet me attempt:\n\n$pattern0: E8 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut that's only 6 bytes (E8 + five more). Wait, let me count:\n\nE8 is one byte, FF7508 is four bytes (FF, 75, 08), then three wildcards. So total of 1+4+3=8 bytes? Or perhaps E8 followed by the displacement as two bytes and a wildcard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include more context:\n\n$pattern0: E8 FF7508 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nThat's 6 bytes if we count E8 (1) + FF7508 (4) but that would be five bytes already. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nI think the best approach is to define each pattern as a specific instruction and its operands with wildcards for any address/offsets:\n\n$pattern0: FF 75 08 ?? ??\n\nBut wait, that's only six bytes (FF + four more). Alternatively, include the E8 before it.\n\nWait, perhaps $pattern0 is from E8 to the next instruction. So including E8 and the displacement as wildcards.\n\nSo:\n\n$pattern0: E8 FF7508 ?? ??\n\nBut again, counting bytes may not be precise without knowing exact structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each pattern should include two or more consecutive instructions with some context. For example:\n\nPattern 0 could be a sequence of mov and push, capturing the displacement as wildcards.\n\nWait, in the first case after E8F7250000, it's E8 FF7508 push. So maybe $pattern0 is FF followed by 7508 with displacements as wildcards.\n\nSo:\n\n$pattern0: FF 75 08 ?? ??\n\nWhich would be six bytes (FF + four more). But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nI think the key is to extract three distinct instruction sequences from the trace, each including the opcodes and operands with wildcards where applicable, ensuring they are 6-20 bytes long.\n</think>\n\nTo generate a corrected Yara rule based on the given task and analysis of the trace data, I'll create three patterns targeting specific call instructions in the code. Each pattern will include relevant opcodes and operands with wildcards for address/offsets.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting specific call sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { FF 75 08 ?? ??. }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 15 3C F1 42 ?? ??? }\n        $pattern2 = { FF ???? 08 ?? ??? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **$pattern0**: Targets the first call after a `mov` instruction, capturing the displacement with wildcards.\n- **$pattern1**: Targets a subsequent call further in the code, including more operands for specificity.\n- **$pattern2**: Captures another distinct call sequence from the trace.\n\nEach pattern is designed to be 6-20 bytes long and uses wildcards where offsets are unknown.
