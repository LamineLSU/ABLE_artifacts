        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to fix this Yara rule because it's not working correctly for bypassing evasions in the malware sample. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the validation errors: each pattern is too short\u2014only 1 byte instead of needing at least 6. Also, there are duplicate patterns where two or more are identical. So my current rule has three patterns that are either too short or duplicates.\n\nThe task says I need to create exactly three different patterns, each 6-20 bytes long. Each pattern should target a different evasion point, meaning they shouldn't be the same sequence.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided, I can see several instructions like conditional jumps (JE, JNE), function calls (CALL), and memory accesses with displacements. My goal is to identify three distinct sequences from these instructions that could bypass the eversion.\n\nLet me start by identifying possible target points in the trace:\n\n1. The call at E8F7250000 followed by some jumps.\n2. A function call near 0041B93C leading into a different path.\n3. Another function call that's bypassed via a different instruction.\n\nI'll need to combine two or three consecutive instructions for each pattern, ensuring they're unique and meet the length requirement.\n\nFor the first pattern, maybe I can take the TEST EAX + JZ + MOV instruction sequence. That would give me 10 bytes including wildcards where needed.\n\nPattern 1: Let's capture a section that includes a conditional jump with an offset, another instruction, and then a function call. For example, combining E8 (call) followed by some operands.\n\nWait, maybe I should take the first few instructions after the main entry point. Like TEST EAX plus JZ plus a mov, which gives me 10 bytes.\n\nPattern 1: $pattern0 = { ... } with 6-20 bytes.\n\nNext, for pattern 2, perhaps another sequence that's different from the first. Maybe involving a different conditional jump and then a function call.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is unique. So maybe one involves E8 (call) followed by some operands, while another uses a different instruction set.\n\nFor pattern 3, I'll look for another distinct combination, ensuring it's not the same as the first two.\n\nNow, considering the address and offset bytes need wildcards, every byte that represents an address or offset should be replaced with ??.\n\nAlso, each pattern must include opcode and register encodings concretely. So opcodes like E8 (call) stay as they are, but addresses or offsets after them become ??\n\nI think I can construct three unique patterns by selecting different instruction sequences from the trace:\n\n1. TEST EAX + JZ + a mov instruction.\n2. E8 (call) with some operands and then another instruction that bypasses.\n3. Another function call with different offset bytes.\n\nLet me draft each pattern, ensuring they are 6-20 bytes and unique.\n\nPattern 0: Maybe starting from the TEST instruction:\n{ 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? } which is 10 bytes.\n\nPattern 1: E8 (call) with some operands, followed by a conditional jump.\n{ E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 75 ?? ... }\n\nWait, the first pattern I thought of was TEST EAX + JZ + a mov. Let me make sure each pattern includes different sequences.\n\nAnother approach: take the initial function calls that are different in their offsets or instruction sets.\n\nAfter reviewing, here's how I can structure each pattern:\n\n- Pattern 0: Combines TEST and JZ with a following mov.\n- Pattern 1: Uses E8 (call) with some operands and then a conditional jump.\n- Pattern 2: Another function call with different displacement bytes.\n\nI need to make sure all three patterns are distinct. Each should have unique sequences of instructions, so their hex byte representations won't be the same as each other or the first pattern.\n\nFinally, I'll create the Yara rule with these three patterns and include the necessary cape_options.\n</think>\n\nTo address the errors in the Yara rule generation, we need to ensure that each pattern is 6-20 bytes long and unique. We also apply wildcards where applicable for address/offset bytes while keeping opcodes and register encodings concrete.\n\nHere's the corrected Yara rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evasion\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule targeting multiple points\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? } <!-- TEST EAX + JZ + mov -->\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 75 ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? } <!-- call with operands followed by conditional jump -->\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 } <!-- another distinct instruction sequence -->\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
