(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to create three different bypass patterns based on the provided trace data. Let's start by understanding what's going on here.\n\nThe trace has two entries where ExitProcess is called at 0041B93C. Looking at the instructions, it seems like there are some checks happening before this call that might be causing the bypass.\n\nIn both traces, after the initial setup (like moving edi to ebp and calling a function), there's a cmp eax, 01h check. Then, if it's not equal to 01h, it jumps to 0041B930h via je or jne. After that, it makes some calls with specific offsets.\n\nThe attacker might be trying to bypass these checks by manipulating the flow. For example, perhaps they set EAX in a way that passes the test or skip certain instructions to avoid jumping.\n\nLooking at the first trace after the call, there's an instruction FF7508 pushing something onto the stack. If this is skipped, maybe it allows the attacker to bypass some checks later on.\n\nSimilarly, other calls like 0042F13Ch and 0042F140h could be points where instructions can be manipulated. Maybe by skipping these calls or altering certain bytes in their offsets.\n\nI need to create patterns that target specific instruction sequences so that when those instructions are skipped (replaced with wildcards), the bypass is achieved.\n\nSo, for each pattern, I'll combine a few consecutive instructions around a key point where an instruction can be skipped. Using wildcards on address or offset bytes will make the pattern match only in certain contexts without triggering new signatures.\n\nLet me draft three different patterns:\n\n1. The first might target the call at 0042F13Ch, skipping it by using ?? for its offset.\n2. The second could bypass the je/jne check after the test al, 01h by setting EAX in a way that skips that instruction.\n3. The third pattern might involve bypassing one of the subsequent calls with FF7508.\n\nI'll ensure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes long and includes all concrete opcodes and registers while using wildcards where necessary for addresses or offsets.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting specific instruction sequences\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B45 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ??
