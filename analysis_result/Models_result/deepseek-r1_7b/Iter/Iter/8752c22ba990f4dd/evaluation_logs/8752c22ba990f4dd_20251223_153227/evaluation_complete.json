From what I understand, we've already tried some strategies without success, and now I need to come up with an improved rule based on the failed attempts.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided, there are two traces where ExitProcess is called at different addresses: 00427B11 and 00427B1A. The calls involve a few instructions before that. For example, in both cases, there's a call to 00427AD7h, which seems to be some kind of subroutine or decision-making code.\n\nI remember the previous strategies tried were Strategy A (check first 30% for CALL TEST EAX JE/JNE), Strategy B (check before exit with conditional logic), and Strategy C (using techniques like RDTSC timing). Since none of these worked, maybe I need to look deeper into how the code is structured.\n\nLooking at the trace, after the call to 00427AD7h, there's a pop ecx instruction followed by another push. Then, before the exit, there's a call to dword ptr [004CC25Ch]. Hmm, maybe this is where the bypass should occur because it's a conditional check that needs to be bypassed.\n\nIn Strategy B, we tried checking before the exit decision, but perhaps focusing on specific instructions after the subroutine could help. Maybe if I can find a pattern right after 00427B1A, which is just before the final call, and create a bypass for that point.\n\nAlso, considering the previous failed attempts where the rule hit but no new signatures, it might be because the patterns were too generic or matched in the wrong place. So, I need to make sure my new patterns are specific enough to only match at the intended points without overlapping elsewhere.\n\nI should look for unique instruction sequences that occur right before the exit call or after certain steps. Maybe there's a conditional jump like JE/JMP that can be bypassed by skipping those lines.\n\nPutting it all together, I think I need three distinct patterns:\n\n1. One targeting the instruction right after 00427B1A where the final call is made. This could involve a specific sequence of bytes from the trace.\n2. Another pattern looking at an earlier point in the trace, maybe just before the subroutine call, to bypass that conditional check.\n3. A third pattern focusing on another unique instruction sequence later in the trace, perhaps right after some operations, to avoid matching other places.\n\nI need to ensure each of these patterns is exactly 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards for any varying offsets or addresses to make them specific enough but not too broad. Also, making sure they don't overlap with existing valid traces would help reduce false positives.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The improved rule focuses on bypassing the conditional checks just before the exit process by identifying unique instruction sequences that can be skipped without affecting program termination.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** API_CHECK | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 70\n\n**REASONING:** The patterns target specific instruction sequences right before or after key subroutine calls, ensuring bypass occurs at the intended decision points to avoid false positives and ensure effective bypass.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with conditional checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 00427B1A FF155CC24C00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 00427B0E FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { 00427B0C 8BEC }\n}\n\ncondition:\n    (any of ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2))\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

            "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given malware trace data to create evasion bypass patterns for a defender. The goal is to extract three different 6-20 byte patterns that can be used to bypass certain checks in the code.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided traces, there are two calls: one at 00427B11 and another at 00427B1A. Both call functions 00427AD7h and 004CC25Ch. The differences between the two traces are at the second part after the push dword ptr instruction.\n\nIn TRACE #1, after the push, there's a call to E8C1FFFFFF at 00427B16, followed by another call at 00427B1A with FF155CC24C00. In TRACE #2, it goes directly from pushing the dword ptr and then another push at 00427B16 before making the same calls.\n\nI need to identify where the attacker's checks might be. Perhaps these calls are part of anti-debugging or sandbox detection mechanisms. The attacker might have placed checks before these calls to trigger an exit instead of continuing execution.\n\nSo, looking for potential points where the code can be bypassed:\n\n1. The first call after the push in both traces is E8C1FFFFFF at 00427B16. If this instruction is skipped, maybe it would allow the program to proceed beyond the check.\n   \n2. The second call after the push is FF155CC24C00 at 00427B1A. Skipping this could bypass another check.\n\n3. There's also a mov instruction before the calls in both cases, possibly part of an initialization or setup that might be monitored. Bypassing this could help bypass checks related to variable assignments or data flow.\n\nI need to create patterns for each of these points by including surrounding instructions and applying wildcards where necessary, ensuring each pattern is 6-20 bytes long.\n\nFor the first bypass target (E8C1FFFFFF at 00427B16), I'll include the push dword ptr instruction before it. The pattern should cover from the push to just before E8C1FFFFFF.\n\nSecond target could be the FF155CC24C00 call, so including the surrounding context around that call.\n\nThird target might involve the mov instruction right after pushing ebp and moving it to esp. Bypassing this would mean skipping the mov and then proceeding with the calls.\n\nI have to make sure each pattern is unique and meets the 6-20 byte requirement by combining multiple instructions, including wildcards for address/offsets as per rules.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass patterns targeting call anti-debugging mechanisms\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {\n            55 8BEC FF7508 E8C1FFFFFF\n        }\n        $pattern1 = {\n            FF7508 FF155CC24C00\n        }\n        $pattern2 = {\n            8BEC FF7508 59\n        }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

            "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to correct the YARA rule based on the given trace data and the previous invalid attempt. Let's start by understanding what the original problem is.\n\nFrom the user's message, they provided a failed YARA rule that didn't meet their requirements. The main issues were missing some basic structure\u2014specifically, the rule was missing the `condition` part and the strings weren't properly defined with patterns. Also, the `cape_options` wasn't included in the meta section.\n\nThe task is to generate a corrected rule that includes exactly three different patterns (each 6-20 bytes long) with wildcards for address/offset bytes, keeping opcodes and registers concrete. The condition should be set to \"any of them\" so that any of the three patterns trigger a bypass.\n\nLooking at the provided trace data, there are two traces, both showing similar instructions around where the bypass is attempted. The key seems to be identifying which parts can be manipulated or skipped to bypass the detection.\n\nThe original invalid rule had:\n- meta with description and cape_options.\n- strings for $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2.\nBut it was missing the condition clause, so it didn't match anything.\n\nSo, I need to define three distinct patterns from the trace instructions. Each pattern should be formed by combining consecutive instructions into a hex string of 6-20 bytes, using wildcards (??) for any address or offset bytes.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\nIn both traces, there's an E8 instruction followed by C1FFFF, then FF7508 in push dword ptr. Then, after some steps, either FF155CC24C00 or something else is called.\n\nI think possible bypass points could be around these E8 instructions or the subsequent pushes and pops of EAX.\n\nSo, I'll try to create three different patterns:\n\n1. Pattern 0: Maybe capture the initial E8 instruction with some wildcards.\n   - Like E8 followed by four unknown bytes (since C1FFFF is hardcoded), then push dword ptr [ebp+08h], so FF7508 could be part of this pattern.\n\n2. Pattern 1: The next possible point after the first E8, maybe capturing the subsequent instructions to bypass a conditional jump or something similar.\n\n3. Pattern 2: Another distinct set that captures different parts of the trace but still allows bypassing an evasion check.\n\nEach pattern needs to be wrapped in { } and have the correct number of bytes with wildcards where applicable.\n\nAlso, I need to include the `cape_options` as specified, which references each pattern and sets action0/action1/action2 to skip.\n\nI should ensure that all three patterns are different. For example:\n\n- Pattern 0 could be E8 followed by C1FFFF and some unknowns.\n- Pattern 1 could involve a conditional jump (like 74 or 75) with unknown offsets, using wildcards.\n- Pattern 2 could capture another part of the code path that can be bypassed similarly.\n\nNow, putting it all together in YARA format, making sure each pattern is properly named and defined with the correct number of bytes and wildcards. Also, checking for any syntax errors like missing braces or incorrect spacing.\n\nFinally, setting the condition to \"any of them\" so that if any of these patterns are detected, the rule skips the bypass.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description: \"Evasion bypass rule targeting three distinct code paths\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ??

            "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help evolve a YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The task is about creating an improved bypass strategy for a sample called 8752c22ba990f4dd. Let's go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the evolution history: Iteration 1 and 2 both resulted in a rule hit but no new signatures. That suggests that whatever patterns were used before aren't effective anymore because they're not being detected now. So, I need to find something different this time.\n\nThe current best rule didn't find any new signatures, so the previous bypass strategies are either too broad or not specific enough. The goal is to be more specific but still cover possible variants of the original sample.\n\nLooking at the trace data provided:\n\nThere are two traces where ExitProcess is called. Both have similar structures: they push some values onto the stack, call a function (00427AD7h), and then make another call with a different dword ptr [ebp+08h]. \n\nThe problem might be that previous patterns matched these calls but didn't find any new signatures because maybe the bypass was happening at a later stage or under certain conditions.\n\nNow, considering the three strategies:\n\nStrategy A: EVASION CHECK in the first 30% of trace. This involves checking if there's an EAX test with JE/JNE before the exit decision. Maybe this is too early and now the code has moved on, so patterns here are not matching anymore.\n\nStrategy B: EXIT DECISION before the exit call. This would involve checking conditional logic that decides whether to exit or continue processing. If there's a condition like a jump, bypassing it could work. \n\nStrategy C: Using specific techniques like RDTSC timing or CPUID. These might be too unique and not present anymore.\n\nGiven the feedback, perhaps Strategy A is no longer effective because after some optimizations, the EAX test isn't in the first 30% anymore. So I need to think of a different approach that's still within these strategies but more specific.\n\nLooking at the trace data again, both ExitProcess calls have:\n\n- push ebp\n- mov esp, ebp (or push dword ptr [ebp+08h])\n- call function (00427AD7h)\n- pop ecx\n- push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n- call another function (004CC25Ch)\n\nSo maybe the issue is that after these calls, there's a conditional jump before the actual exit. For example, if the program jumps based on some condition, bypassing that could be effective.\n\nI should look for patterns where there's a conditional check (like JE/JMP) followed by the ExitProcess call. If I can find such a pattern, then targeting that point might work better.\n\nAlso, considering Strategy A again but maybe looking further into the trace to see if after these calls, there's an EAX test with JE, which was previously in the first 30% now moved later on. So perhaps by shifting the bypass point earlier or using a different instruction pattern, it can catch again.\n\nAnother thought is that maybe the previous bypass patterns didn't account for all possible variations of the sample. For example, if there's an offset that varies (like EAX test at different offsets), then matching exactly might not work anymore. Using wildcards could help make the pattern more flexible without being too broad.\n\nLooking back at Strategy C: Maybe using a timing-based bypass like RDTSC or CPUID is still viable, but I have to ensure they're applied correctly and don't cause issues elsewhere.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that all patterns must come from the original trace data. So any pattern used in YARA has to be exactly found in the provided hex data. Therefore, I need to look for sequences of instructions within these traces.\n\nLooking at the first trace:\n\n- After pushing ebp and mov esp, there's a call to 00427AD7h.\n- Then, after pop ecx, another push dword ptr [ebp+08h], then a call to 004CC25Ch.\n\nPerhaps if I can find a JE or conditional jump before these calls that was previously bypassed. Alternatively, maybe the initial push and mov are being used in a way that's now different.\n\nWait, both traces have similar structures, so perhaps the problem is consistent across them. Maybe after these calls, there's an instruction like cmp eax, some_value followed by a JE/JMP, which could be a target for bypass.\n\nSo maybe I can look for a specific sequence where after the initial push and mov, there's a conditional check before proceeding to ExitProcess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in one of the traces, the call 004CC25Ch is followed by a loop or another function that needs to be bypassed. But since both traces end with ExitProcess, maybe focusing on what happens right after the initial calls would be better.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the previous bypass rules didn't account for different instruction sequences in EAX test (JE/JNE). If I can make sure the pattern is more specific but still covers possible offsets or conditions, it might work again.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Strategy A needs to be adjusted. Instead of looking at the first 30%, maybe look a bit later where the EAX test with JE/NJE is now located. However, since we need patterns from the trace, I have to find exact matches.\n\nLooking through the hex data:\n\nIn both traces, after the initial push and mov, there's an E8C1FFFFFF instruction (call dword ptr [00427AD7h]), then 59 pop ecx, FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h], E8C1FFFFFF again call dword ptr [004CC25Ch].\n\nWait, in the first trace, after the second E8C1FFFFFF instruction at 00427B11, there's a call to 00427AD7h. Then, in the second trace, same structure.\n\nBut looking at the exit points: The ExitProcess is called twice with different parameters but similar steps.\n\nPerhaps the key difference is that before the final call, there might be an instruction like cmp eax, some_offset followed by a JE or something else. If I can find such a pattern in one of the traces, it could be targeted for bypass.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the initial calls, there's another conditional jump that needs to be bypassed. For example, if there's a call to a function like printf or another subroutine that has its own conditional logic.\n\nBut without seeing more instructions beyond what's provided, it's hard to tell. So perhaps focusing on specific bytes from the trace would help.\n\nLooking at the first trace:\n\nAfter 00427B16 (pop ecx), there's FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h], then E8C1FFFFFF call dword ptr [004CC25Ch]. So maybe before that, if there's a conditional instruction like cmp eax, ... followed by JE/JMP.\n\nIf I can find such a pattern in the trace, it would be good to target it. But since both traces seem similar, perhaps looking for a specific variation is necessary.\n\nAlternatively, considering Strategy B: checking for conditional logic before ExitProcess. Maybe there's an instruction like cmp eax, some_value followed by JE or something else that's being called before the final exit.\n\nSo maybe I can create a pattern that looks for:\n\n- After initial push ebp and mov esp, call function A.\n- Then check if some condition is met (like comparing eax to a value).\n- If yes, jump to another point; if no, continue.\n- Then make the ExitProcess call.\n\nIf this exists in the trace, then bypassing before the conditional would work. So perhaps the pattern for Strategy B could be targeting that conditional check.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using RDTSC timing is feasible, but I'm not sure how to apply it without more context from the sample.\n\nConsidering all of this, maybe a combination of Strategy A and B can help. But since I have to provide three patterns, perhaps two variations for Strategy A (since both traces are similar) or one each for A, B, C.\n\nWait, no: The user says \"3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace.\" So they must be different sequences found in the trace data.\n\nLooking again at the hex instructions:\n\n- E8C1FFFFFF is a call instruction.\n- FF7508 is pushing a dword ptr [ebp+08h].\n- 59 pop ecx.\n- Then another FF7508 push.\n\nPerhaps one pattern can target the initial push and mov, assuming that's where the bypass should happen. Another could target after the first call but before the second push. The third might be targeting a specific conditional instruction if found.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the calls to 004CC25Ch or other dword ptrs could help.\n\nWait, in both traces, there are two call instructions: one at E8C1FFFFFF (after push ebp) and another at FF757508 pushing a different dword ptr. Maybe these can be part of the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for specific sequences where after the initial setup, there's a conditional check before proceeding to ExitProcess.\n\nI think I need to create three distinct 6-20 byte patterns that are found in the trace data and apply them in the YARA rule. Each should target a different possible point of exit, making sure they don't repeat previous strategies but still cover potential evasion methods.\n\nSo, tentatively:\n\n1. Pattern for initial setup (push ebp, mov esp): Look for this at an early position to bypass EAX test.\n2. Pattern after first call (E8C1FFFFFF) and before conditional: Target the conditional jump before ExitProcess.\n3. Another pattern that uses a different instruction sequence found in the trace.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is specific enough but still presentable as per the hex data.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nPattern 0: Initial setup (push ebp, mov esp)\nPattern 1: Conditional check after first call\nPattern 2: Another unique sequence involving dword ptr pushes\n\nEach of these needs to be translated into YARA-compatible patterns with wildcards where applicable.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous bypass attempts failed because the patterns matched earlier in the trace, which is now no longer present. The updated strategy shifts focus to a conditional check before the ExitProcess call, ensuring it targets the correct point without overlapping with prior ineffective strategies.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: EVASION CHECK (60% success)\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: By focusing on a conditional jump before the ExitProcess, we target a likely evasion point that hasn't been bypassed yet. This specific approach aims to intercept the code at a stage where it's less commonly used.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass targeting conditional checks before exit\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [0x85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? 8B 45 FC] } // Initial setup\n        $pattern1 = { [0xE8C1FFFFFF ??

            "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user create an improved YARA bypass rule based on their provided trace data and previous attempts. Let's start by understanding what they have.\n\nFrom the trace analysis, there are two exit process calls at different offsets: 00427B11 and 00427B1A. Each of these is preceded by a call to 00427AD7h. The user tried strategies A, B, and C but didn't get any new signatures.\n\nFirst, looking at the traces:\n\n- Both have push ebp followed by mov esp, etc.\n- Both call 00427AD7h with E8C1FFFFFF, which is a call instruction.\n- Then they call dword ptr [ebp+08h] either as part of the same trace.\n\nThe user's previous strategies didn't work because maybe their patterns matched but were in the wrong location or too broad.\n\nI should consider using Strategy A again since it had a 60% success rate. It checks the first 30% for a test+je pattern before the exit call. Since both traces have a call to AD7h, perhaps there's an instruction after that which triggers the bypass.\n\nLooking at the trace steps:\n\nAfter E8C1FFFFFF (call), they do FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Then in the first case, it's another call. Maybe if I can find a test+je after the initial push but before the second call?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the instruction right after the E8C1FFFFFF as the bypass point.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nIn both traces, after E8C1FFFFFF is FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]). Then in trace 1, it's another call. In trace 2, that line becomes a different instruction: FF155CC24C00.\n\nWait, perhaps for the first exit process at 00427B11, there's an instruction before the second call that could be used as bypass.\n\nBut since both exits are similar, maybe I should focus on one and find a unique instruction sequence in the other. Alternatively, check if after E8C1FFFFFF, any specific instruction can trigger a bypass.\n\nAnother approach is to look for specific patterns like test+je or conditional jumps before the exit call. Maybe using FF7508 as part of the pattern with some condition that's always true.\n\nWait, in trace 2, instead of another call, it does a different instruction: FF155CC24C00. That could be unique and perhaps can be used for bypass.\n\nSo maybe I should create three patterns:\n\n1. After E8C1FFFFFF (the first exit call), check if there's a test+je after pushing the dword ptr [ebp+08h]. Maybe the next instruction is a conditional jump or some instruction that triggers.\n2. Use FF7508 with specific bytes in the trace to create a bypass pattern, targeting either trace 1 or 2 depending on the offset.\n3. Another unique instruction from one of the traces.\n\nI need to make sure each pattern is exactly 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards where necessary. Each pattern must be different.\n\nLet me try drafting them:\n\nPattern 1: After E8C1FFFFFF, push dword ptr [ebp+08h], then a conditional instruction that's always true or something.\nBut wait, in the first trace, after FF7508 comes another call, which might not help. In trace 2, it's a different instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the instruction right before the exit call as the bypass point with some condition.\n\nWait, I think using the specific instruction right after E8C1FFFFFF could be useful. Let me check:\n\nIn both traces, immediately after E8C1FFFFFF is FF7508 (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]). Then in trace 2, it's different, but in trace 1, another call.\n\nSo maybe for the first bypass point, I can use the instruction sequence starting at E8C1FFFFFF and then check if after pushing, there's a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, create a pattern that includes FF7508 followed by something else. For example, the next instruction is a different jump or a conditional.\n\nWait, perhaps for the first pattern, I can use:\n\nE8C1FFFFFF (call) followed by some condition and mov, but since it's always pushing dword ptr [ebp+08h], maybe look for that push instruction as part of the bypass.\n\nSo Pattern 1 could be: E8C1FFFFFF, then FF7508, plus a specific instruction. Maybe using the next byte after FF7508 to create a condition.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, use the fact that both traces have this push and different exits.\n\nWait, another approach is to find a specific instruction in one of the traces that can be used for bypassing. For example, in trace 2, after E8C1FFFFFF comes FF155CC24C00, which might be unique enough.\n\nSo Pattern 2 could be: E8C1FFFFFF (call), then FF155CC24C00.\n\nPattern 3 could use another instruction from either trace. Maybe the mov instruction before or after.\n\nAlternatively, since both traces have a push dword ptr [ebp+08h], maybe create two patterns using that with different offsets.\n\nWait, but in the first trace, it's after E8C1FFFFFF and then another call. In the second trace, same initial steps but ends up at 00427B1A.\n\nHmm. Maybe instead of focusing on push dword ptr [ebp+08h], look for a specific instruction right before the exit point in each case.\n\nBut considering that both traces are similar except for one step, maybe it's better to create patterns based on those differences.\n\nSo, putting this together, I'll draft three patterns:\n\n1. A pattern matching after E8C1FFFFFF and FF7508 with a specific instruction.\n2. Using the unique instruction in trace 2: FF155CC24C00 as part of the bypass.\n3. Another specific instruction from one of the traces, maybe the next instruction after FF7508.\n\nI need to ensure each pattern is different and uses exact hex values where possible with wildcards for offsets.\n\nSo here's how I can structure them:\n\nPattern 1: E8C1FFFFFF (call) followed by FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] and then some instruction that triggers bypass. Since in trace 2, after FF7508 it's a different call, maybe using the specific instruction from there.\n\nWait, perhaps for pattern 1, I can use E8C1FFFFFF (call) followed by FF7508 with a condition that's always true or something else, but since they are similar in both traces, maybe just take that sequence as part of the bypass.\n\nAlternatively, create two patterns: one using the instruction after E8C1FFFFFF and another for trace 2.\n\nI think I'll go with three distinct patterns based on the unique steps in each trace. Each will be a 6-byte pattern from the trace.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**\n\nThe previous attempts focused on specific strategies without enough specificity, leading to failed rule hits or incorrect locations. By analyzing the traces and considering the success rates of different strategies, I identified three distinct patterns that can bypass the exit calls more effectively. Each pattern is derived from unique instruction sequences in the traces, ensuring they are specific yet broad enough to match intended bypass points.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**\n\nThe patterns target bypassing exit calls using conditional checks or unique instruction sequences found in the trace data.\n\n**CONFIDENCE**\n\n60% confidence for each pattern due to their specificity and alignment with successful strategies.\n\n**REASONING**\n\nEach pattern is crafted from exact instructions present in the trace, ensuring they match intended bypass points without being too specific (using wildcards for variable bytes). Together, these patterns aim to bypass exit calls while avoiding false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [8B 75 08 C1 E8 FF] }\n        $pattern1 = { [FF 75 08 C1 8C 42] }\n        $pattern2 = { [FF 15 5C CC 24 C0] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

            "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The original trace shows two exit processes with specific instructions. Let me analyze the traces and see where the bypass can be applied.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1: It starts with a push on ebp, then moves esp to ebp, pushes some data, calls 00427AD7h, pops ecx, and then another call. The ExitProcess is called after that.\n\nIn TRACE #2: Similar structure but the second call is different\u2014FF155CC24C00 instead of E8C1FFFFFF. This might be where the bypass should occur because it's a conditional call before the exit.\n\nI remember previous attempts didn't find new signatures, so maybe I need to look for patterns in these specific calls. Since the ExitProcess is called conditionally, perhaps checking if the offset matches could help.\n\nI'll focus on the second call instruction in both traces. The offset after the call is 00427B1A and has a different value each time (E8C1FFFFFF vs FF155CC24C00). These are likely specific enough to target without matching too many other processes.\n\nSo, I'll create two patterns: one for each call instruction. Each will check if the next byte after the offset is zero, indicating a conditional jump where the exit isn't taken.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**:  \nWe identified that the bypass occurs in the second call instructions at different offsets (00427B11 and 00427B1A) with specific values. By checking if these calls have an offset of zero, we target only the conditional jumps where the exit isn't triggered.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**:  \n- **CALL_TEST_JE**\n- **API_CHECK**\n- **CMP_SETZ**\n\n**REASONING**:  \nThese patterns check for specific call offsets that indicate a conditional jump. The use of zero ensures we bypass only when the exit is blocked, increasing specificity without false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - checked conditional calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 00427B11 FF155CC24C00 ? }\n        $pattern1 = { 00427B11 E8C1FFFFFF ? }\n        $pattern2 = { 00427B1A FF155CC24C00 ? }\n\n    condition:\n        (any)\n}\n```",
