Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create an improved YARA bypass rule based on the feedback from previous attempts. The original trace shows two exit processes with specific instructions. Let me analyze the traces and see where the bypass can be applied.\n\nLooking at TRACE #1: It starts with a push on ebp, then moves esp to ebp, pushes some data, calls 00427AD7h, pops ecx, and then another call. The ExitProcess is called after that.\n\nIn TRACE #2: Similar structure but the second call is different\u2014FF155CC24C00 instead of E8C1FFFFFF. This might be where the bypass should occur because it's a conditional call before the exit.\n\nI remember previous attempts didn't find new signatures, so maybe I need to look for patterns in these specific calls. Since the ExitProcess is called conditionally, perhaps checking if the offset matches could help.\n\nI'll focus on the second call instruction in both traces. The offset after the call is 00427B1A and has a different value each time (E8C1FFFFFF vs FF155CC24C00). These are likely specific enough to target without matching too many other processes.\n\nSo, I'll create two patterns: one for each call instruction. Each will check if the next byte after the offset is zero, indicating a conditional jump where the exit isn't taken.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**:  \nWe identified that the bypass occurs in the second call instructions at different offsets (00427B11 and 00427B1A) with specific values. By checking if these calls have an offset of zero, we target only the conditional jumps where the exit isn't triggered.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**:  \n- **CALL_TEST_JE**\n- **API_CHECK**\n- **CMP_SETZ**\n\n**REASONING**:  \nThese patterns check for specific call offsets that indicate a conditional jump. The use of zero ensures we bypass only when the exit is blocked, increasing specificity without false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - checked conditional calls\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 00427B11 FF155CC24C00 ? }\n        $pattern1 = { 00427B11 E8C1FFFFFF ? }\n        $pattern2 = { 00427B1A FF155CC24C00 ? }\n\n    condition:\n        (any)\n}\n```",
