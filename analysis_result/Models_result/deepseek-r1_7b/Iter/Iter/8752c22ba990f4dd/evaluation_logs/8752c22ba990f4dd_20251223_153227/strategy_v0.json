Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create a better YARA rule for bypassing the malware sample with SHA256: 8752c22ba990f4dd. From what I understand, we've already tried some strategies without success, and now I need to come up with an improved rule based on the failed attempts.\n\nFirst, looking at the trace data provided, there are two traces where ExitProcess is called at different addresses: 00427B11 and 00427B1A. The calls involve a few instructions before that. For example, in both cases, there's a call to 00427AD7h, which seems to be some kind of subroutine or decision-making code.\n\nI remember the previous strategies tried were Strategy A (check first 30% for CALL TEST EAX JE/JNE), Strategy B (check before exit with conditional logic), and Strategy C (using techniques like RDTSC timing). Since none of these worked, maybe I need to look deeper into how the code is structured.\n\nLooking at the trace, after the call to 00427AD7h, there's a pop ecx instruction followed by another push. Then, before the exit, there's a call to dword ptr [004CC25Ch]. Hmm, maybe this is where the bypass should occur because it's a conditional check that needs to be bypassed.\n\nIn Strategy B, we tried checking before the exit decision, but perhaps focusing on specific instructions after the subroutine could help. Maybe if I can find a pattern right after 00427B1A, which is just before the final call, and create a bypass for that point.\n\nAlso, considering the previous failed attempts where the rule hit but no new signatures, it might be because the patterns were too generic or matched in the wrong place. So, I need to make sure my new patterns are specific enough to only match at the intended points without overlapping elsewhere.\n\nI should look for unique instruction sequences that occur right before the exit call or after certain steps. Maybe there's a conditional jump like JE/JMP that can be bypassed by skipping those lines.\n\nPutting it all together, I think I need three distinct patterns:\n\n1. One targeting the instruction right after 00427B1A where the final call is made. This could involve a specific sequence of bytes from the trace.\n2. Another pattern looking at an earlier point in the trace, maybe just before the subroutine call, to bypass that conditional check.\n3. A third pattern focusing on another unique instruction sequence later in the trace, perhaps right after some operations, to avoid matching other places.\n\nI need to ensure each of these patterns is exactly 6-20 bytes and uses wildcards for any varying offsets or addresses to make them specific enough but not too broad. Also, making sure they don't overlap with existing valid traces would help reduce false positives.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING:** The improved rule focuses on bypassing the conditional checks just before the exit process by identifying unique instruction sequences that can be skipped without affecting program termination.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE:** API_CHECK | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 70\n\n**REASONING:** The patterns target specific instruction sequences right before or after key subroutine calls, ensuring bypass occurs at the intended decision points to avoid false positives and ensure effective bypass.\n\n**YARA_RULE:**\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved with conditional checks\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 00427B1A FF155CC24C00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 00427B0E FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { 00427B0C 8BEC }\n}\n\ncondition:\n    (any of ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2))\n```",
