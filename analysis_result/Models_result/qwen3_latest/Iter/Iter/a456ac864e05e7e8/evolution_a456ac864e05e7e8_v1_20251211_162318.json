The rule includes three distinct patterns that match different parts of the code flow, with appropriate wildcard replacements for address and offset values where necessary.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ YARA Rule: `Bypass_Sample`\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass pattern based on control flow manipulation\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Explanation of the Patterns\n\n1. **`$pattern0`**:  \n   - Matches the call to a function (`E8`) followed by a `push ebp` instruction (`59`).  \n   - The offset of the `E8` call is replaced with `??` because it's not fixed.  \n   - This pattern identifies the initial setup of the stack frame before function calls.\n\n2. **`$pattern1`**:  \n   - Matches a `push [ebp+0x08]` instruction (`FF 75 08`) followed by a call to a function (`FF 15`).  \n   - The address of the call (`FF 15` followed by 4 bytes) is replaced with `??` since it's not fixed.  \n   - This pattern is useful for identifying indirect function calls or jump targets.\n\n3. **`$pattern2`**:  \n   - Matches the initial setup of the stack frame: `mov edi, edi`, `push ebp`, `mov ebp, esp`, and `push [ebp+0x08]`.  \n   - All values in this pattern are fixed and do not require wildcard replacement.  \n   - This pattern helps identify the beginning of a function's prologue.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Key Notes\n\n- **Wildcard Use (`??`)**: Used to mask addresses and offsets that vary between instances, making the rule more robust.\n- **Length Constraints**: All patterns are within the 6–20 byte range, which is standard for YARA rules.\n- **Flexibility**: The rule can detect variations of the same control flow behavior across different memory regions or processes.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Usage\n\nThis rule is ideal for malware analysis or intrusion detection systems where the goal is to detect or bypass control flow integrity checks. You can integrate it into a broader detection framework or use it in conjunction with other rules to improve detection accuracy.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to expand this rule to detect more variations or include additional behaviors!",

The trace shows a call to `___crtCorExitProcess` followed by `ExitProcess`, suggesting the evasion check occurs earlier.

These patterns are specific to the trace but flexible enough for variants.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 70\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target critical points in the execution flow: the function prologue (stack setup), the call to `___crtCorExitProcess` (potential evasion check), and the `ExitProcess` call (exit decision). By focusing on these locations, we avoid matching generic exit calls and instead target the actual bypass logic.
