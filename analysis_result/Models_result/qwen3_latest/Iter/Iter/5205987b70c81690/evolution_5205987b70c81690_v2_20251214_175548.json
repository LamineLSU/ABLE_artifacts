      "raw_response": "To address the request, we are to identify **three distinct byte sequences** from the provided disassembled code that can be used as **patterns** in a **bypass or analysis tool**. These patterns are to be used with **cape_options** to identify and skip certain behaviors in a dynamic analysis environment.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Selected Patterns from the Trace**\n\nWe are given the following disassembled code snippet (partial):\n\n```\n0040E7F1  8BEC             mov ebp, esp\n0040E7F3  FF7508          push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n0040E7F6  E8C8FFFFFF      call ___crtCorExitProcess\n0040E7FB  59              pop ecx\n0040E7FC  FF7508          push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n0040E7FF  FF15ACB04100    call dword ptr [0041B0AC]\n```\n\nFrom this, we extract the following **byte patterns** that are both **unique and represent meaningful instructions**:\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Pattern 0: `E8 C8 FFFF`**  \n**Description:** This is the **call instruction** to the function `___crtCorExitProcess`, which is part of the CRT (C Runtime) and is often used in termination sequences.  \n**Length:** 6 bytes  \n**Hex:** `E8 C8 FFFF`  \n**Usage:** This pattern can be used to detect or skip calls to CRT exit functions during analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Pattern 1: `FF 15 AC B0 41 00`**  \n**Description:** This is the **call instruction** to the `ExitProcess` function, which is a standard Windows API for terminating the current process.  \n**Length:** 6 bytes  \n**Hex:** `FF 15 AC B0 41 00`  \n**Usage:** This pattern is useful for identifying direct calls to process termination, which can be skipped in dynamic analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Pattern 2: `FF 75 08 FF 15 AC B0 41 00`**  \n**Description:** This represents a **sequence of instructions** starting with a `push` of `[ebp+08h]`, followed by a call to `ExitProcess`. This sequence is often seen in Windows API calls for process termination.  \n**Length:** 9 bytes  \n**Hex:** `FF 75 08 FF 15 AC B0 41 00`  \n**Usage:** This pattern helps in identifying a complete call to `ExitProcess` along with its register setup, which can be used for more granular control in analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Final Answer**\n\n```plaintext\nPattern 0: { E8 C8 FFFF }\nPattern 1: { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }\nPattern 2: { FF 75 08 FF 15 AC B0 41 00 }\n```\n\nThese patterns can be used with **cape_options** to identify and skip process termination logic in dynamic analysis, aiding in the bypass of anti-debugging or anti-analysis techniques.",
