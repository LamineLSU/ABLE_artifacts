      "raw_response": "Here's a structured analysis and the final answer based on the observed code flow and instruction sequences:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Sequence 1 (Test + Jump):**  \n   The first two instructions are consecutive and represent a conditional jump:\n   ```\n   85 C0 (test eax, eax)  \n   74 12 (je 008A6190h)\n   ```\n   These are likely part of a conditional branch logic.\n\n2. **Sequence 2 (Call to CloseHandle + Push):**  \n   The call to `CloseHandle` is followed by a `push ebx` instruction:\n   ```\n   FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (call to CloseHandle)  \n   53 (push ebx)\n   ```\n   This sequence is likely part of a cleanup or resource management block.\n\n3. **Sequence 3 (Call to ExitProcess + XOR):**  \n   The call to `ExitProcess` is immediately followed by an `xor edi, edi` instruction:\n   ```\n   FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (call to ExitProcess)  \n   33 FF (xor edi, edi)\n   ```\n   This is likely a termination or cleanup block.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n```plaintext\nPattern0: FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 33 FF  \nPattern1: 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B  \nPattern2: FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? 53\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- **Pattern0:** The call to `ExitProcess` (`FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??`) is followed by `xor edi, edi` (`33 FF`), indicating a cleanup or termination sequence.\n- **Pattern1:** A conditional jump sequence (`test eax, eax` followed by `je`) suggests control flow logic.\n- **Pattern2:** A call to `CloseHandle` followed by `push ebx` is likely part of a resource cleanup or exception handling block.\n\nThese patterns are distinct, consecutive, and represent different code behaviors in the observed binary.",
