      "raw_response": "Here is a well-structured **YARA rule** that identifies **specific low-level assembly patterns** associated with **Windows API function calls** (like `ExitProcess` and `RtlFreeHeap`), including **memory manipulation** and **register usage**. These patterns are derived from the observed instruction sequences in the disassembled code.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **YARA Rule: Detecting Windows API Function Calls and Memory Manipulation**\n\n```yara\nrule WindowsAPIFunctionCalls\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects calls to Windows API functions like ExitProcess and RtlFreeHeap, along with associated memory manipulation.\"\n        author = \"Security Researcher\"\n        date = \"2025-04-05\"\n        platform = \"Windows\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = {83 C4 14 52 FFD0} // add esp, 14h; push edx; call eax (ExitProcess)\n        $b = {8B 16 50 51 FFD2} // mov edx, [esi]; push eax; push ecx; call edx (RtlFreeHeap)\n        $c = {8D 44 04 ?? ?? ?? ?? 50 FFD2} // lea esi, [eax+...] (displacement is an address); push esi; call edx (RtlFreeHeap)\n\n    condition:\n        $a or $b or $c\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Explanation of the Rules**\n\n#### 1. **`$a` - ExitProcess Call**\n- **Assembly**:  \n  ```asm\n  add esp, 14h\n  push edx\n  call eax\n  ```\n- **Behavior**:  \n  This sequence is commonly used to clean up the stack before calling `ExitProcess`, which terminates the current process. `eax` is typically used to hold the address of the `ExitProcess` function.\n\n#### 2. **`$b` - RtlFreeHeap Call**\n- **Assembly**:  \n  ```asm\n  mov edx, [esi]\n  push eax\n  push ecx\n  call edx\n  ```\n- **Behavior**:  \n  This pattern is typical when calling `RtlFreeHeap`, which is used to free memory allocated by the Windows heap manager. The `edx` register holds the function pointer, and `esi` points to a structure or variable containing the heap handle or other parameters.\n\n#### 3. **`$c` - Lea Instruction with Displacement**\n- **Assembly**:  \n  ```asm\n  lea esi, [eax+0x00000C74]\n  push esi\n  call edx\n  ```\n- **Behavior**:  \n  The `lea` instruction computes an effective address and stores it in `esi`. The displacement (`0x00000C74`) is likely a pointer to a memory location, possibly a function pointer or a heap structure. This pattern is often used to prepare a pointer before calling a function like `RtlFreeHeap`.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Use Cases**\n- **Malware Analysis**: Identify potential API calls that may be used for process termination or memory cleanup.\n- **Exploit Detection**: Recognize patterns that may indicate heap corruption or memory leak exploitation.\n- **Forensic Analysis**: Track memory management routines in suspicious processes.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ **Next Steps**\n- Add more rules for other APIs like `VirtualAlloc`, `CreateProcess`, or `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`.\n- Use `pe` or `import` rules to find these functions in PE files.\n- Combine with static analysis tools like **IDA Pro**, **Ghidra**, or **Volatility** for deeper inspection.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to expand this into a full **malware detection suite** or analyze a specific binary!",

      "raw_response": "Based on the provided TRACE DATA, here are three distinct patterns that can be identified:\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 1: Call to `RtlAllocateHeap`**\n- **Hex Instruction Sequence:**  \n  `50 51 FFD2 5E 5D C3`  \n- **Disassembly:**  \n  ```asm\n  push eax     ; 50\n  push ebx     ; 51\n  call edx     ; FFD2\n  pop esi      ; 5E\n  pop edi      ; 5D\n  ret          ; C3\n  ```\n- **Explanation:**  \n  This sequence is commonly used to call `RtlAllocateHeap` in Windows kernel code. The `push` and `pop` instructions are used to preserve and restore register values, and the `call edx` is the actual function call.\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 2: Call to `RtlFreeHeap`**\n- **Hex Instruction Sequence:**  \n  `52 52 FFD0`  \n- **Disassembly:**  \n  ```asm\n  push edx     ; 52\n  push edx     ; 52\n  call eax     ; FFD0\n  ```\n- **Explanation:**  \n  This sequence is often used to call `RtlFreeHeap`. The `push edx` instructions are likely used to pass the heap handle and possibly the allocation tag, while `call eax` executes the function.\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 3: Call to `ExitProcess`**\n- **Hex Instruction Sequence:**  \n  `FFD0`  \n- **Disassembly:**  \n  ```asm\n  call eax     ; FFD0\n  ```\n- **Explanation:**  \n  This is a direct call to `ExitProcess` (or similar termination functions). The `call eax` instruction transfers control to the function pointer stored in the `eax` register, which is typically set to point to the `ExitProcess` function.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThese patterns are indicative of common kernel functions in Windows:\n- **Pattern 1:** `RtlAllocateHeap` (heap allocation)\n- **Pattern 2:** `RtlFreeHeap` (heap deallocation)\n- **Pattern 3:** `ExitProcess` (program termination)\n\nEach pattern reflects a distinct calling convention and function behavior, which can be used for reverse engineering or debugging purposes.",

      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt failed due to insufficient specificity in patterns, leading to false positives or missed critical code flow points. By focusing on the call to `RtlAllocateHeap` (FFD2), the call to `0041AF60h` (E8 44 09 00 00), and the ASCII '\\' push (51), we target the evasion logic's core operations. These patterns are concrete and unique, reducing the risk of false matches while aligning with the sample's execution path.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 95\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns directly reference the sample's critical code flow, including heap allocation checks and function calls. The first pattern captures the allocation logic, the second targets a specific function call, and the third identifies the ASCII '\\' push, all of which are essential for evasion. Specificity ensures minimal false positives while maximizing detection accuracy.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { FFD2 52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 44 09 00 00 56 }\n        $pattern2 = { 51 52 8B16 50 51 FFD2 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
