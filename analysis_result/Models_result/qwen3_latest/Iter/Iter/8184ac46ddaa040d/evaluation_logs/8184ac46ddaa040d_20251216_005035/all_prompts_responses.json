      "response_text": " C<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this malware evasion analysis. The user provided a trace of a malware that exits early, probably due to sandbox detection. The goal is to find three bypass points by analyzing counterfactual scenarios. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the trace data. The exit happens at address 00C761F8, which is the call to ExitProcess. The instruction before that is a call to CloseHandle, and before that, there's a test eax, eax followed by a je to 00C75E83. So the program exits because the test eax, eax is zero, leading to the je, which jumps to the exit.\n\nPhase 1: Establish the factual outcome. The program exits via ExitProcess. The path is: after some code, it reaches the call to ExitProcess. So the exit is due to a conditional jump that leads to the exit.\n\nPhase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses. For each suspicious instruction, ask what if it's skipped. Let's look for instructions that, if skipped, would prevent the exit. \n\nLooking at the trace, the key points are the test eax, eax instructions. The first test at 00C7617A checks EAX, and if zero, jumps to 00C76190. Then later, after some code, there's another test eax, eax at 00C76188, leading to a je to 00C75E83. If either of these tests is bypassed, the je might not happen, allowing the code to continue.\n\nAnother possible point is the call to ExitProcess itself. If that call is skipped, the program wouldn't exit. But how? Maybe if the code before that is modified so that it doesn't reach that call.\n\nLooking at the call to ExitProcess at 00C761F8, the previous instruction is a push ebx, and the call is to ExitProcess. So if the call is skipped, the program would continue. But how to skip that call? Maybe if the code before it is altered.\n\nBut the user wants to find instructions where skipping them would prevent the exit. Let's focus on the test instructions and the jumps.\n\nFirst, the first test at 00C7617A. If this test is skipped, then the je would not occur, so the code would proceed to the next instruction. But the je is at 00C7618A, which is a conditional jump. If the test is skipped, maybe the code would continue. However, the test is part of a conditional flow. So if the test is bypassed (like the EAX is not zero), then the je is skipped, and the code proceeds. But how to make that happen? The user wants to find points where skipping an instruction would bypass the evasion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the malware checks for certain conditions (like VM detection) and exits if found. So if we can find where those checks are done, and modify them to bypass.\n\nLooking at the code, after the first test, there's a call to 00C7667Fh. Then another test, then a je. If the first test is skipped, maybe the code would not jump to the exit. But how to determine which instructions are critical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the malware is checking for certain VM features. For example, the call to CloseHandle might be part of checking for a sandbox. If that call is skipped, the program might not exit.\n\nBut the user wants to find three patterns. Let's look for the three most likely points where skipping would bypass.\n\nLooking at the trace, the ExitProcess call is at 00C761F8. The previous instruction is a push ebx. So the call is to ExitProcess. If that call is skipped, the program would not exit. But how to skip that call? Maybe by modifying the call instruction itself. However, the user wants to find the instruction that, if skipped, would prevent the exit.\n\nAnother point is the je at 00C7618A, which jumps to 00C75E83. If that jump is skipped (i.e., the test before it is not zero), then the code proceeds. So if the test is modified to not trigger the je, the code continues. But how to represent that in a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the code after the je at 00C7618A is the jump to 00C75E83. If that je is bypassed, the code would continue. But the je is conditional on the test eax, eax. So if the test is skipped (like EAX is not zero), then the je is not taken, and the code proceeds.\n\nBut the user wants to find the exact instructions where skipping would prevent the exit. So let's look for the instructions that are part of the conditional flow leading to the exit.\n\nAnother possible point is the call to 00C71680h at 00C761C6. If that call is skipped, maybe the code proceeds. But I need to check the surrounding code.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the call to ExitProcess, which is the final exit. So the instruction at 00C761F8 is the call. If that call is skipped, the program continues. But how to skip it? Maybe by modifying the call instruction itself, but the user wants to find the instruction that, if skipped, would prevent the exit.\n\nSo the three best bypass points would be:\n\n1. The test eax, eax at 00C7617A. If this test is skipped (like EAX is not zero), then the je is not taken, and the code proceeds. So skipping this test would prevent the exit.\n\nBut how to represent that in a pattern. The instruction is 85 C0. The next instruction is je 00C76190h. So the pattern would include the test and the je. Let's create a pattern that includes the test and the je.\n\nPattern 0: 85 C0 74 12 ... ?\n\nWait, the je is at 00C7617C, which is the instruction after the test. The je instruction is 74 12. The next instruction is push 5B. So the pattern would be the test, je, and some following instructions. Let's take the test, je, and the push.\n\nBut the user requires 6-20 bytes. Let's take the test (85 C0), je (74 12), push 5B (6A 5B), and the following instructions. That's 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B 5A 8B CE ... but maybe that's too long. Alternatively, take the test, je, and the push, which is 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B. That's 6 bytes. But need to include the call to 00C7667Fh. Wait, the je is at 00C7617C, which is the instruction after the test. Then the code proceeds to push 5B, pop edx, etc. So the pattern could be the test, je, and the push. That's 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B. But the je is 74 12, which is 2 bytes. So the test is 85 C0 (2 bytes), je is 74 12 (2 bytes), push is 6A 5B (2 bytes). Total 6 bytes. That's acceptable.\n\nAnother possible point is the je at 00C7618A (0F 84 33 FD FF FF). If this je is skipped, the code proceeds. So the pattern would include the test eax, eax (85 C0) leading to this je. But the test is at 00C76188. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\nAfter some code, there's:\n\n00C76188: test eax, eax\n00C7618A: je 00C75E83\n\nIf this test is skipped (EAX not zero), then the je is not taken, and the code proceeds. So the pattern would include the test and the je. Let's take the test (85 C0), then the je (0F 84 33 FD FF FF). But the je is 0F 84 followed by the offset. So the pattern would be 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??, but the offset bytes need to be replaced with ??.\n\nWait, the je instruction is 0F 84, followed by 4 bytes of offset. So the pattern would be 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes. But the user wants 6-20 bytes. So this could be a valid pattern.\n\nThird point: the call to ExitProcess at 00C761F8. The instruction is E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (call). If this call is skipped, the program continues. So the pattern would include the call instruction. But the call is preceded by a push ebx (50). So the pattern could be 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 6 bytes. But the call's offset is replaced with ??.\n\nAlternatively, the call is at 00C761F8, which is the instruction. The previous instruction is push ebx (50). So the pattern would be 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 6 bytes.\n\nSo the three patterns would be:\n\nPattern0: 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B (test, je, push)\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (test, je with offset)\nPattern2: 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push, call)\n\nWait, but need to make sure the patterns are different. Let me check the addresses again.\n\nFirst pattern: test at 00C7617A (85 C0), je at 00C7617C (74 12), then push 5B (6A 5B). So the pattern is 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B. That's 6 bytes.\n\nSecond pattern: test at 00C76188 (85 C0), je at 00C7618A (0F 84 33 FD FF FF). So the pattern would be 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes.\n\nThird pattern: push ebx (50) and call to ExitProcess (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??). So 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, 6 bytes.\n\nThese are three different patterns. Now, applying the wildcard rules. For the call instruction, the offset bytes (4 bytes after E8) are replaced with ??, so E8 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nFor the je instructions, the offset bytes (4 bytes after 0F 84) are replaced with ??.\n\nSo the three patterns would be:\n\nPattern0: 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B\nPattern1: 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??\nPattern2: 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nBut wait, the first pattern is 85 C0 (test), 74 12 (je), then 6A 5B (push). So the first three instructions are 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B. That's 6 bytes.\n\nThe second pattern is the test at 00C76188 (85 C0), then the je (0F 84 ...). So the pattern would be 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes.\n\nThird pattern is the push and call: 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nThese three patterns are different and meet the 6-20 bytes requirement. Now, check if the wildcards are correctly applied. For the call instruction, the offset is replaced with ??, and for the je instruction, the offset is also replaced. The opcode bytes (like 85, 74, 0F, 84, 50, E8) are kept as concrete.\n\nSo the YARA rule would have these three patterns. Let me format them correctly with spaces between hex bytes and wildcards.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B }\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 50 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n",
      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt failed due to incorrect pattern extraction. The new patterns are derived directly from the trace, focusing on critical evasion checks (test eax, je) and exit-related instructions (call ExitProcess). The third pattern captures a unique sequence of push operations, ensuring specificity and reducing false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | DEBUG_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 85 | 80 | 75\n\n**REASONING**: The first pattern targets the evasion check logic (test eax, je) which likely validates conditions before termination. The second pattern captures the direct call to ExitProcess, a strong indicator of program termination. The third pattern identifies a unique sequence of push operations, which may be part of function parameter setup, further confirming the evasion mechanism.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 53 6A 40 53 68 40 11 C7 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6.
