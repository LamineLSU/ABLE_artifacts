The trace shows critical checks around `test eax, eax` followed by `je` jumps (Strategy A) and a direct call to `ExitProcess` (Strategy B). By targeting these specific instruction sequences from the trace, we increase confidence in matching the correct evasion logic. The patterns are derived directly from the original trace to avoid false positives.\n\n---\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \n**CONFIDENCE**: 75  \n\n**REASONING**: The first pattern captures a `test eax, eax` followed by a `je` jump and a `push` instruction, which likely represents a conditional check. This is a common evasion mechanism where the program flow is altered based on register values. The second pattern targets another `test eax, eax` with a longer `je` offset, which may represent a more complex check. The third pattern focuses on the `ExitProcess` call itself, which is the ultimate termination point and often protected by anti-evasion logic.\n\n---\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B }  // test eax, eax; je; push\n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 33 FD FF FF }  // test eax, eax; je with offset\n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? }  // call to ExitProcess (address varies)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
