(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "To analyze the provided disassembled code snippet and identify patterns that could be useful in a YARA rule, we can extract meaningful sequences of instructions that likely represent critical behavior, such as function calls or setup routines.\n\nHere are the **three distinct patterns** derived from the code:\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 1: Setup for a Function Call**\nThis sequence includes the setup of the stack frame (push ebp, mov ebp, esp), followed by a push of a register (possibly a function parameter), and a call to a function (`___crtCorExitProcess`).\n\n**Hex Signature:**\n```\n8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 E8 C8 FF FF FF\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `8B FF` = `mov edi, edi` (no-op, possibly a placeholder)\n- `55` = `push ebp` (save base pointer)\n- `8B EC` = `mov ebp, esp` (set new base pointer)\n- `FF 75 08` = `push [ebp+08]` (push a register or parameter)\n- `E8 C8 FF FF FF` = `call ___crtCorExitProcess` (call to CRT function)\n\n**Use Case:**  \nThis sequence is likely part of a function prologue or setup for a CRT function call. It can be used to detect code that initializes the stack for a function or prepares for a call to a CRT-related function.\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 2: Call to Exit Process (Exit Function)**\nThis pattern identifies the call to an exit function, such as `ExitProcess` or a similar function, and includes the preceding push operation.\n\n**Hex Signature:**\n```\nFF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `FF 75 08` = `push [ebp+08]` (pushing a register or parameter)\n- `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` = `call <exit_function>` (call to an exit function, with offset)\n\n**Use Case:**  \nThis pattern is useful for detecting attempts to terminate the process, which is a common behavior in malicious or benign programs. It could be used to flag code that is attempting to exit the application.\n\n---\n\n### **Pattern 3: Call to CRT Function (___crtCorExitProcess)**\nThis pattern focuses on the direct call to the CRT function `___crtCorExitProcess`, which is used in some C++ applications to handle exit logic.\n\n**Hex Signature:**\n```\nE8 C8 FF FF FF\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `E8 C8 FF FF FF` = `call ___crtCorExitProcess` (call to CRT function)\n\n**Use Case:**  \nThis is a direct signature for the CRT function `___crtCorExitProcess`. It can be used to detect the presence of this function in a binary, which may be part of a C++ application's exit logic.\n\n---\n\n### **YARA Rule Examples**\n\n```yara\nrule Pattern1 {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Setup for CRT function call\"\n    strings:\n        $a = { 8B FF 55 8B EC FF 75 08 E8 C8 FF FF FF }\n    condition:\n        $a\n}\n\nrule Pattern2 {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Call to Exit Process (Exit Function)\"\n    strings:\n        $b = { FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n    condition:\n        $b\n}\n\nrule Pattern3 {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Call to CRT function ___crtCorExitProcess\"\n    strings:\n        $c = { E8 C8 FF FF FF }\n    condition:\n        $c\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThese patterns are useful for detecting specific behaviors such as:\n- Function call setup\n- Exit process attempts\n- CRT function usage\n\nThey can be used in malware analysis, reverse engineering, or binary classification tasks to identify potential indicators of interest.",

The `FF 15` is the opcode for a `call` instruction with a 32-bit relative address, and the following bytes are the offset to the target function.\n\n2. **`$call_to_crtcor_exitprocess`**  \n   - **Pattern**: `E8 C8 FFFF FF 59`  \n   - **Description**: This is a call to the `___crtCorExitProcess` function (likely a CRT helper function), followed by a `pop ecx` instruction. The `E8` is the `call` opcode, and the 4-byte offset points to the function. The `59` is the `pop ecx` instruction.\n\n3. **`$push_and_call`**  \n   - **Pattern**: `FF 75 08 FF 15 AC B0 41 00`  \n   - **Description**: This is a sequence of instructions that first pushes the value at `[ebp+08h]` onto the stack (`FF 75 08`), and then calls `ExitProcess` (`FF 15 AC B0 41 00`). This is a typical setup for a function call, where the parameter is passed via the stack.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Why These Patterns Are Effective**\n\n- **Specificity**: These patterns are not generic but are based on **exact byte sequences** found in the memory dump, making them highly specific to the observed code.\n- **Behavioral Insight**: They capture the **function call behavior** and **stack manipulation**, which are key indicators of function invocation and control flow.\n- **Use Case**: This rule can be used in malware analysis, reverse engineering, or static code analysis to detect specific code patterns that may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Usage Notes**\n\n- Ensure that the YARA rule is applied to a memory dump or binary file containing the target code.\n- This rule assumes the addresses and opcodes match the exact dump you're analyzing. If you're working with a different dump, you may need to adjust the byte sequences accordingly.\n- You can extend the rule to include more patterns or conditions for greater detection coverage.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion**\n\nThis YARA rule provides a precise and targeted method for identifying specific code patterns that are likely to be part of a function call sequence involving `ExitProcess` and CRT functions. By using **exact byte sequences**, the rule is both **specific and robust**, making it suitable for advanced analysis and detection tasks.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.
