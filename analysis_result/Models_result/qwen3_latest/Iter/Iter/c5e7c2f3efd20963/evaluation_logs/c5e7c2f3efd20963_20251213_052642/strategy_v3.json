(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

Since the exact offset can vary across different builds or versions, using wildcards allows for flexibility while still matching the instruction format.\n\n- **Combined Pattern:**  \n  The full pattern `{ FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }` captures the exact sequence of bytes that identifies this specific `CALL` instruction, making it both precise and adaptable to variations in the offset.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Why This Works**\n\nThis approach ensures that the rule matches only the specific `CALL` instruction at `00427B11`, avoiding false positives from other `CALL` instructions elsewhere in the code.

It is both precise and robust against minor variations in the offset.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

        "response_text": "To address the problem, we need to **identify specific byte sequences** from the given assembly code that are **not related to the exit call** but rather to **setup or conditional logic** that might be part of an **evasion mechanism**. The key is to avoid targeting the `ExitProcess` call (which is a direct exit) and instead look for **setup instructions** or **conditional checks** that may be part of the evasion logic.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**Three distinct YARA patterns derived from the provided assembly code:**\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionCheck\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects potential evasion logic setup\"\n    \n    strings:\n        $a = { FF 75 08 E8 C1 FF FF FF }  // Push [ebp+08h] followed by call to ___crtCorExitProcess\n        $b = { FF 75 03 FF 15 5C C2 4C 00 }  // Push [ebp+03h] followed by call to ExitProcess\n        $c = { 55 8B EC FF 75 08 }  // Push ebp, mov ebp, push [ebp+08h]\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Explanation of Each Pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern `$a`**  \n   - **Bytes:** `FF 75 08 E8 C1 FF FF FF`  \n   - **Instruction Sequence:**  \n     - `FF 75 08` \u2192 `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`  \n     - `E8 C1 FF FF FF` \u2192 `call 00427AD7h` (to `___crtCorExitProcess`)  \n   - **Purpose:** This is the setup before calling the CRT exit function, which might be part of the **evasion logic** (e.g., preparing the stack or arguments for the exit).\n\n2. **Pattern `$b`**  \n   - **Bytes:** `FF 75 03 FF 15 5C C2 4C 00`  \n   - **Instruction Sequence:**  \n     - `FF 75 03` \u2192 `push dword ptr [ebp+03h]`  \n     - `FF 15 5C C2 4C 00` \u2192 `call dword ptr [004CC25Ch]` (to `ExitProcess`)  \n   - **Purpose:** This is the **direct call to `ExitProcess`**, which is the **exit action** and should be **avoided** in this context. However, it is included for completeness, and we should **not** consider it as part of the evasion logic.\n\n3. **Pattern `$c`**  \n   - **Bytes:** `55 8B EC FF 75 08`  \n   - **Instruction Sequence:**  \n     - `55` \u2192 `push ebp`  \n     - `8B EC` \u2192 `mov ebp, esp`  \n     - `FF 75 08` \u2192 `push dword ptr [ebp+08h]`  \n   - **Purpose:** This is **standard function prologue** and may be used to **setup the stack** before any conditional checks. It's a **potential setup** for evasion logic.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Summary\n\n- **Target:** The evasion logic **setup**, not the actual exit.\n- **Avoid:** Direct call to `ExitProcess` (pattern `$b`).\n- **Focus:** Use patterns like `$a` and `$c` to detect **preparation steps** or **conditional logic** that might be part of an evasion mechanism.\n\nThis approach ensures that the **patterns are specific**, **non-overlapping**, and **aligned with the structure of the provided assembly code**.",
