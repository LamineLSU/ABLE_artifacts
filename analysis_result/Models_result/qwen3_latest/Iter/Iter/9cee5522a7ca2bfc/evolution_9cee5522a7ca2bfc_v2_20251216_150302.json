      "raw_response": "To effectively bypass the call to `ExitProcess` and prevent the program from terminating, we need to identify the key instructions that lead to the call and create patterns that represent those instructions. The goal is to create **YARA-like patterns** that can detect or bypass the termination logic, typically by skipping or altering the flow of execution.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Key Instructions Leading to `ExitProcess`\n\nFrom the provided trace, we can identify the following critical instructions:\n\n1. **Jump to `ExitProcess` Call**  \n   - Instruction: `EB E1` (short jump to offset `+0x01`)\n   - Target: `FF96 2C E0 00 00` (call to `ExitProcess` at offset `0x011CEEA6`)\n   - This jump leads directly to the `ExitProcess` call.\n\n2. **Call to `ExitProcess`**  \n   - Instruction: `FF96 2C E0 00 00`\n   - This is the actual call to the Windows API function `ExitProcess`.\n\n3. **Call to `VirtualProtect`**  \n   - Instruction: `FFD5` (call to `ebp`, which is the address of `VirtualProtect`)\n   - This function is often used to modify memory protection, and skipping this call could allow the program to avoid certain checks.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Recommended Patterns\n\nHere are the **YARA-style patterns** that represent these key instructions, with **wildcards** for address parts (since the exact memory addresses may vary):\n\n#### 1. **Jump to `ExitProcess` Call (10 bytes)**\n```yara\nrule SkipExitProcessJump\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Skips the jump to ExitProcess\"\n    strings:\n        $a = { EB E1 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF 96 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n    condition:\n        $a\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- `EB E1` is the short jump instruction (offset `+0x01`)\n- `FF96 ...` represents the call to `ExitProcess` (the exact bytes are replaced with `??` as they vary by memory address)\n- This pattern can be used to detect or bypass the jump to the termination call.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Call to `ExitProcess` (6 bytes)**\n```yara\nrule SkipExitProcessCall\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Skips the call to ExitProcess\"\n    strings:\n        $b = { FF 96 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n    condition:\n        $b\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- `FF96 ...` is the call to `ExitProcess`\n- The `??` placeholders represent the variable address of the function\n- This pattern can be used to detect the actual termination call\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Call to `VirtualProtect` (5 bytes)**\n```yara\nrule SkipVirtualProtectCall\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Skips the call to VirtualProtect\"\n    strings:\n        $c = { FFD5 }\n    condition:\n        $c\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- `FFD5` is the call to `ebp`, which points to `VirtualProtect`\n- Skipping this call could allow the program to bypass memory protection checks, potentially avoiding detection or termination\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Summary of Patterns\n\n| Pattern Name | Description | Length (bytes) |\n|--------------|-------------|----------------|\n| `SkipExitProcessJump` | Skips the jump to `ExitProcess` | 10 |\n| `SkipExitProcessCall` | Skips the call to `ExitProcess` | 6 |\n| `SkipVirtualProtectCall` | Skips the call to `VirtualProtect` | 5 |\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Notes\n\n- These patterns are useful in **reverse engineering** or **malware analysis** to identify or bypass termination logic.\n- In real-world scenarios, the exact memory addresses and instruction encodings may vary, so using wildcards (`??`) is essential.\n- These patterns can be used in **YARA**, **IDA Pro**, or **Ghidra** to detect or modify the behavior of the program.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to expand this to include more advanced analysis or detection logic.",
