            "response_text": " No<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this YARA rule correction. The user mentioned that the previous rule was too generic because it used just the CALL instruction without enough context. The error message said to add 4+ context bytes, like TEST/CMP/JZ after the CALL. \n\nLooking at the original trace data, the ExitProcess call is at 0040E7F6. The instruction there is E8C8FFFFFF, which is a CALL to 0040E7C3. Then there's a PUSH and another CALL to 0041B0ACh. \n\nThe user wants three different patterns, each 6-20 bytes, with wildcards for addresses. Let me look at the surrounding instructions. \n\nFirst, the call to ExitProcess is at 0040E7F6. The previous instructions are push ebp, mov ebp, push dword [ebp+08h], then the call. Maybe combining the call with the preceding push and mov? Wait, the call is followed by a pop ecx and another push. \n\nWait, the trace shows the call to ExitProcess is at 0040E7F6. Let me list the relevant instructions:\n\nAddress      Opcode               Instruction\n0040E7F6  E8C8FFFFFF           call 0040E7C3h\n0040E7FB  59                   pop ecx\n0040E7FC  FF7508               push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n0040E7FF  FF15ACB04100         call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]\n\nSo the call to ExitProcess is at 0040E7F6. Let me see the surrounding instructions. Before that call, there's a push dword [ebp+08h], then the call. Maybe the call is part of a sequence. \n\nBut the user wants three different patterns. Let me think about the possible sequences. \n\nFirst pattern: The call to ExitProcess (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??) followed by the pop ecx (59) and push. Wait, the call is at 0040E7F6, then the next instruction is 0040E7FB (pop ecx). So the call is followed by a pop. Maybe combining the call with the preceding push and the following pop? Let me check the bytes. \n\nThe instruction before the call is FF7508 (push dword [ebp+08h]), then the call. Then after the call, there's 59 (pop ecx), then another push. \n\nSo maybe the first pattern is the push, call, and pop. Let me get the opcodes:\n\nFF 75 08 (push) followed by E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (call), then 59 (pop). That would be 6 bytes? Wait, FF 75 08 is 3 bytes, E8 is 1 byte, then the 4 bytes for the offset. Wait, the call instruction is E8 followed by 4 bytes. So the call itself is 5 bytes. But the push is 3 bytes. So combining the push and the call would be 3 + 5 = 8 bytes? Wait, the push is at 0040E7F3, then the call at 0040E7F6. So the push is 3 bytes (FF 75 08), then the call is 5 bytes (E8 C8 FFFF FF). Then the next instruction is 59 (pop). So combining the push, call, and pop would be 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 bytes. But the call's offset bytes are 4 bytes (C8 FFFF FF). Wait, the call instruction is E8 followed by 4 bytes. So the call itself is 5 bytes. So the push is 3 bytes, call is 5 bytes, then the pop is 1 byte. So combining those three instructions would be 3+5+1=9 bytes. But the call's offset bytes are part of the pattern. So the pattern would be FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59. That's 3+5+1=9 bytes. Wait, the E8 is 1 byte, then 4 bytes for the offset. So the total is 3 (push) + 1 (call opcode) + 4 (offset) + 1 (pop) = 9 bytes. That's acceptable. So that's one pattern.\n\nSecond pattern: The call to ExitProcess (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??) followed by the pop and the next push. Wait, after the call, there's 59 (pop ecx) then FF7508 (push dword [ebp+08h]). So maybe combining the call, pop, and push. That would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08. That's 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 bytes. But the call's offset is 4 bytes, so the pattern would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08. Wait, the call is 5 bytes (E8 + 4 bytes), then 59 (1 byte), then FF7508 (3 bytes). So that's 5+1+3=9 bytes. But the call's offset is 4 bytes, so the pattern would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08. That's 9 bytes. That's another pattern.\n\nThird pattern: The call to the other function (FF15ACB04100) which is the call to ExitProcess. The instruction is FF 15 AC B0 41 00. That's 6 bytes. But the user wants 6-20 bytes. So maybe combining the previous push, the call, and the following push. Wait, the call to ExitProcess is at 0040E7FF. The instruction before that is 0040E7FC: FF7508 (push), then the call FF15ACB04100. Then after that call, there's nothing in the trace provided. Wait, the trace only shows up to 0040E7FF. So maybe the third pattern is the push (FF7508) followed by the call (FF15ACB04100). That would be 3 bytes for the push, 6 bytes for the call (FF 15 AC B0 41 00). So total 9 bytes. But the call's offset is 4 bytes (AC B0 41 00). Wait, the call instruction is FF 15 followed by 4 bytes. So the pattern would be FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 bytes. Wait, FF 75 08 is 3 bytes, then FF 15 is 1 byte, followed by 4 bytes of offset. So the pattern would be FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 bytes. That's acceptable. \n\nWait, but the user wants three different patterns. Let me check the three patterns:\n\nPattern 0: FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 (push, call, pop)\nPattern 1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08 (call, pop, push)\nPattern 2: FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push, call to ExitProcess)\n\nWait, but the second call is FF15... which is a call to a memory address. So that's another pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third pattern is the call to ExitProcess (FF15...) and the surrounding instructions. Let me see. The call to ExitProcess is at 0040E7FF. The previous instruction is 0040E7FC: FF7508 (push), then the call. So combining those two instructions would be FF7508 FF15 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is 3 + 6 = 9 bytes. \n\nSo three patterns could be:\n\n1. FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 (push, call, pop)\n2. E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08 (call, pop, push)\n3. FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push, call to ExitProcess)\n\nBut need to make sure each pattern is 6-20 bytes. Let's check:\n\nPattern 0: FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 \u2192 3 + 5 (call) + 1 (pop) = 9 bytes. Wait, the call is E8 followed by 4 bytes, so the call is 5 bytes. So the total is 3 (push) + 5 (call) + 1 (pop) = 9 bytes. That's okay.\n\nPattern 1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08 \u2192 5 (call) + 1 (pop) + 3 (push) = 9 bytes. \n\nPattern 2: FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? \u2192 3 (push) + 6 (call) = 9 bytes. \n\nYes, all are within the 6-20 range. \n\nNow, the user wants wildcards for addresses. In the call instructions, the offset bytes are replaced with ??, which is correct. \n\nSo the three patterns would be:\n\nPattern 0: FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59\nPattern 1: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08\nPattern 2: FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nWait, but the second call is FF15 followed by 4 bytes. So the pattern for that would be FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? \u2192 3 + 6 = 9 bytes. \n\nBut the user's example had patterns with varying lengths. So these three patterns should work. \n\nNow, putting it all together into the YARA rule. The condition is any of them. \n\nSo the final YARA rule would have three patterns, each with the appropriate opcodes and wildcards. Let me make sure there are no overlaps and that each pattern is distinct. \n\nYes, the first two patterns include the call to 0040E7C3 (E8) and the third is the call to 0041B0ACh (FF15). So they are different. \n\nThus, the corrected YARA rule should have these three patterns.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule ExitProcess_Call_Context\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects calls to ExitProcess with contextual instructions\"\n        author = \"Security Researcher\"\n        date = \"2023-10-15\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = { FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 }\n        $b = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF 75 08 }\n        $c = { FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of ($a, $b, $c)\n}\n```",
