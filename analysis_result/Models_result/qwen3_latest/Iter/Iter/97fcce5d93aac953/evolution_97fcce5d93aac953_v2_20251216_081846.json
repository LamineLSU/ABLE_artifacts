      "raw_response": "To effectively target the critical exit paths in the provided code snippet, we focus on the instructions that directly invoke the `ExitProcess` and `__crtCorExitProcess` functions. These calls are likely used as part of the malware’s evasion or termination logic. The goal is to construct three **specific patterns** that can be used to identify and potentially bypass these exit paths.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 1: `call` to `ExitProcess` with surrounding `push` instruction**\n**Bytes (hex):**  \n`FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??`  \n**Length:** 10 bytes  \n**Description:**  \nThis pattern includes the `push` instruction (`FF 75 08`) immediately preceding the `call` to `ExitProcess` (`FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??`). If the `call` is skipped, the program may not terminate via this path.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 2: `call` to `__crtCorExitProcess` with preceding `push` instruction**\n**Bytes (hex):**  \n`FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`  \n**Length:** 8 bytes  \n**Description:**  \nThis pattern includes the `push` instruction (`FF 75 08`) preceding the `call` to `__crtCorExitProcess` (`E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`). If this `call` is skipped, the program may not exit via this path, potentially allowing further execution.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 3: `call` to `ExitProcess` with surrounding `pop` and `push` instructions**\n**Bytes (hex):**  \n`59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??`  \n**Length:** 12 bytes  \n**Description:**  \nThis pattern includes the `pop` instruction (`59`), followed by a `push` (`FF 75 08`), and then the `call` to `ExitProcess` (`FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??`). If the `call` is skipped, the program may not terminate via this path.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Summary\nThese three patterns are designed to:\n- Identify and potentially bypass the exit paths used in the malware.\n- Include enough context (like `push`, `pop`, and `call`) to reduce false positives.\n- Use wildcard `??` for address bytes to ensure compatibility across different memory layouts.\n\nBy targeting these patterns, you can effectively identify and potentially disrupt the exit logic of the malware.",
