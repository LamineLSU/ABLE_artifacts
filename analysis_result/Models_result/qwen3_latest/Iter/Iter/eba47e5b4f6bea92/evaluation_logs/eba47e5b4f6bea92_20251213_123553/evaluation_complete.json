and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

            "response_text": "E<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this YARA rule creation step by step. First, I need to understand the malware's evasion mechanism based on the provided trace data. The exit process is called at address 003061F8, which is the ExitProcess function from KERNEL32. The malware is likely checking for sandbox environments and terminating early if detected.\n\nStarting with Step 1: Identify suspicious instructions. Looking through the trace, I see several conditional jumps (JE, JZ), test instructions, and function calls. These are common in evasion checks. For example, the first test eax, eax followed by je 00306190h might be checking if a certain value is zero, which could indicate a VM.\n\nStep 2: Trace the exit path backwards. The exit occurs at 003061F8, which is a call to ExitProcess. The instruction before that is a push ebx, then the call. The jump leading to this exit is at 003061F7, which is a call to ExitProcess. The previous instruction is a push ebx. So, the exit is triggered by a call to ExitProcess, which is likely after some checks.\n\nNow, Step 3: Select 3 different bypass candidates. The idea is to find instructions that, if skipped, would bypass the evasion. For example, if the malware checks for certain conditions and jumps to exit if true, modifying those checks could bypass it. Possible candidates could be the test instructions, the call to ExitProcess, or the conditional jumps that lead to it.\n\nLooking at the trace, the call to ExitProcess is at 003061F8. The instruction before that is a push ebx (003061F7). The jump to this call is from 003061FE, which is a xor edi, edi followed by mov eax, edi. Wait, maybe I need to look at the flow. Let me retrace.\n\nThe exit is at 003061F8. The instruction before that is 003061F7: push ebx, then call ExitProcess. The jump to this call is from 003061FE, which is a xor edi, edi, then mov eax, edi, then jmp 00306207h. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look at the addresses again.\n\nLooking at the trace:\n\n- 003061F7: push ebx\n- 003061F8: call ExitProcess\n- 003061FE: xor edi, edi\n- 00306200: mov eax, edi\n- 00306202: jmp 00306207h\n\nSo the call to ExitProcess is at 003061F8. The previous instruction is push ebx. The jump leading to this call is from 003061F7, which is the push ebx. Wait, maybe the call is preceded by a jump. Let me check the flow.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nAfter some operations, the code reaches 003061F7 (push ebx) then calls ExitProcess. The jump to this call might be from an earlier conditional jump. For example, earlier in the trace, there's a je 00305E83h at 0030618A and 003061A5. These jumps could be part of the evasion checks.\n\nSo, the exit is triggered by a call to ExitProcess. The conditions leading to that call are the je instructions. For example, the first je at 0030617C (je 00306190h) could be checking for a certain condition. If that condition is met, it jumps to a part of the code that eventually leads to ExitProcess.\n\nNow, to create bypass patterns, I need to find sequences that, if modified, would skip the exit. For example, if the malware checks for a certain value and jumps to exit if true, modifying the test instruction or the jump could bypass it.\n\nLet me look for possible sequences:\n\n1. The first test eax, eax (0030617A) followed by je 00306190h. If this test is bypassed, the je is skipped, leading to the code that eventually calls ExitProcess. So, a pattern could be the test and je instructions.\n\n2. The call to ExitProcess is at 003061F8. The instruction before is push ebx. If this push is skipped, the call might not execute. But how to bypass that? Maybe if the code jumps over the call.\n\n3. Another possible point is the je at 0030618A (0F8433FDFFFF) which leads to 00305E83h. If this jump is bypassed, the code would proceed to the next instructions, which might include the call to ExitProcess.\n\nSo, three different patterns could be:\n\nPattern 0: The test eax, eax followed by je (0030617A-0030617C)\nPattern 1: The je at 0030618A (0F8433FDFFFF) leading to the exit path\nPattern 2: The call to ExitProcess and the preceding push ebx (003061F7-003061F8)\n\nNow, building each pattern with 6-20 bytes, including wildcards for addresses.\n\nFor Pattern 0: The test and je. The instruction at 0030617A is 85 C0 (test eax, eax), then 74 12 (je 00306190h). The next instruction is push 5B. So combining these three instructions: 85 C0 74 12 6A 5B. That's 6 bytes. But the je's offset is 12h, which is 18 bytes from the je instruction. Wait, the je at 0030617C (address 0030617C) has an offset of 12h, which is 18 bytes. But in the pattern, we need to include the offset as ?? since it's an address. Wait, the je instruction is 74 12, which is the opcode followed by a 1-byte offset. So the offset is 12h, which is 18 bytes. But in the YARA rule, we need to replace address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nSo, the first pattern would be the test instruction (85 C0) followed by the je (74 12). But the je's offset is 12h, which is 18 bytes. However, in the YARA pattern, the offset bytes (the 12h) should be replaced with ?? because it's an address. Wait, the je instruction's offset is part of the instruction. So the je instruction is 74 followed by the offset. So in the pattern, the je instruction is 74 12, but the 12 is an offset. So in the YARA rule, we need to replace the offset bytes with ??.\n\nSo, the first pattern could be: 85 C0 74 ?? (test eax, eax followed by je with offset). But that's only 4 bytes. Wait, the je instruction is 74 followed by a 1-byte offset. So the je instruction is 74 12 (assuming the offset is 12h). But in the pattern, the offset is part of the instruction. However, according to the wildcard rules, any address/offset bytes must be replaced with ??.\n\nSo the je instruction's offset (the 12h) is an address offset, so it should be replaced with ??.\n\nSo the first pattern would be the test instruction (85 C0) followed by the je instruction (74 ??). But that's 4 bytes. To make it 6-20 bytes, maybe include the next instruction. For example, the test, je, and the next instruction (push 5B). So 85 C0 74 ?? 6A 5B. That's 6 bytes. The ?? represents the offset of the je instruction.\n\nAnother pattern could be the je at 0030618A (0F8433FDFFFF). The je instruction is 0F 84 followed by a 4-byte offset. The offset here is 33FDFFFF, which is part of the instruction. So in the pattern, the je instruction is 0F 84 followed by ?? (since the offset is an address). So the pattern would be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but that's 6 bytes). However, the je instruction itself is 0F 84 followed by 4 bytes of offset. So the pattern would be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes). But the actual instruction is 0F 84 33 FD FF FF. So replacing the offset bytes with ?? gives 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??.\n\nThird pattern: the call to ExitProcess (003061F8) and the previous push ebx (003061F7). The push ebx is 53 (assuming ebx is the register), but looking at the trace, the instruction at 003061F7 is push ebx, which is 53. Then the call to ExitProcess is E8 followed by a 4-byte offset. So the pattern would be 53 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes). The 53 is the push ebx, then the call instruction with offset.\n\nSo the three patterns would be:\n\nPattern0: 85 C0 74 ?? 6A 5B (test, je, push)\nPattern1: 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (je with offset)\nPattern2: 53 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push ebx, call ExitProcess)\n\nBut need to check the exact opcodes and ensure the wildcards are correctly applied.\n\nAnother possibility is the test eax, eax (85 C0) and the je (74 12), but the offset 12 is part of the je instruction. So the pattern would be 85 C0 74 ?? (test, je with offset). That's 4 bytes. To make it longer, maybe include the next instruction (push 5B) as 6A 5B, making the pattern 85 C0 74 ?? 6A 5B (6 bytes).\n\nSimilarly, the je at 0030618A is 0F 84 followed by 4 bytes of offset. So the pattern would be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes).\n\nFor the third pattern, the push ebx is 53, then call ExitProcess is E8 followed by 4 bytes of offset. So the pattern is 53 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes).\n\nThese three patterns are different and each 6 bytes long. They cover different parts of the code leading to the exit. This should satisfy the requirements.\n</think>\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 ?? 6A 5B }\n        $pattern1 = { 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 53 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n5. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n6. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n7. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern. Include target + context. |\n| **\"address bytes\" / \"hardcoded\"** | Raw addresses in pattern | Replace ALL address/offset bytes with `??`. CALL offsets = 4 bytes after opcode. |\n| **\"duplicate patterns\"** | Two patterns are identical | Select DIFFERENT instruction sequences from the trace. |\n| **\"cape_options missing\"** | No bypass metadata | Add to meta: `cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"` |\n| **\"syntax error\"** | Invalid YARA format | Check: braces `{ }` around hex, spaces between bytes, pattern names start with `$` |\n| **\"not 3 patterns\"** | Wrong pattern count | Must have exactly `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` |\n\n### Byte-Level Fix Examples\n\n**CALL instruction (E8 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `E8 25 05 00 00` (hardcoded offset)\n- Right: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP short (74/75 + 1 offset byte):**\n- Wrong: `74 1A` or `75 0C`\n- Right: `74 ??` or `75 ??`\n\n**Conditional JMP near (0F 84/0F 85 + 4 offset bytes):**\n- Wrong: `0F 84 8A 00 00 00`\n- Right: `0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Memory access with displacement:**\n- Wrong: `8B 45 FC` (stack offset FC)\n- Right: `8B 45 ??`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 CORRECT FORMAT TEMPLATE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 ?? 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate ONLY the corrected YARA rule following the template above.
