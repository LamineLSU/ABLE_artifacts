      "raw_response": " -<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this YARA rule creation. The user provided a malware trace that exits early due to evasion, and I need to create three patterns from the trace data. The patterns must be 6-20 bytes, use wildcards for addresses, and be specific to evasion points.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the trace data again. The key evasion point is the call to ExitProcess at 008061F8. Let me look at the surrounding instructions to find possible patterns.\n\nLooking at the address 008061F8, the instruction is FF152CA18000 which is a call to ExitProcess. The previous instruction is 53 (push ebx) at 008061F7. So maybe a pattern that includes the push and the call. Let me check the bytes around that. The instruction before the call is 53, then the call. Let me see the bytes:\n\nAt 008061F7: 53 (push ebx)\nThen 008061F8: FF152CA18000 (call dword ptr [0080A12Ch])\n\nSo combining these two instructions would be 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? which is 8 bytes. But the call's offset is 0080A12C, which is a memory address. So replacing the address parts with ??, the pattern would be 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes. That's a valid pattern.\n\nAnother evasion point might be the call to CloseHandle at 008061F1. The instruction there is FF1588A08000. The previous instruction is 50 (push eax) at 008061F0. So combining those two instructions: 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes again. That's another pattern.\n\nNow, looking for a third pattern. Let's check earlier in the trace. For example, the call to 008044B9h at 008061E7. The instruction is E84B170000. The previous instruction is 33C9 (xor ecx, ecx) at 008061E2. So combining these two instructions: 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 8 bytes. That's a third pattern.\n\nWait, but the user wants three different patterns. Let me check if these are all distinct. The first pattern is 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push ebx followed by call), the second is 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (push eax followed by call), and the third is 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (xor ecx, ecx followed by call). These are all different sequences.\n\nBut I need to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes. The first three are 8 bytes each, which is acceptable. Let me verify the exact bytes.\n\nFor the first pattern: 008061F7 is 53, then 008061F8 is FF15 followed by the address. So the bytes are 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (8 bytes). That's correct.\n\nSecond pattern: 008061F0 is 50, then 008061F1 is FF15. So 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (8 bytes).\n\nThird pattern: 008061E2 is 33 C9, then 008061E7 is E8 followed by the offset. So 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (8 bytes). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are longer patterns. For example, looking at the call to 00801680h at 008061C6. The instruction is E8E3FAFFFF. The previous instruction is B9428C8000 (mov ecx, 00808C42h). So combining those two instructions: B9 42 8C 80 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but that's 10 bytes). Wait, the B9 is part of the mov instruction. Let me check the exact bytes.\n\nAt 008061C5: B9428C8000 (mov ecx, 00808C42h). Then 008061C6: E8E3FAFFFF (call). So the bytes would be B9 42 8C 80 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but the B9 instruction is 4 bytes, then E8 is another 4 bytes. Wait, the B9 is part of the mov instruction. So the first instruction is B9 42 8C 80 00 (but wait, B9 is the opcode for mov ecx, imm32. The immediate is 428C8000. So the instruction is 5 bytes: B9 42 8C 80 00. Then the next instruction is E8 E3 FA FF FF (call). So combining these two instructions would be 5 + 4 = 9 bytes. But the call's offset is 008061C6 to 00801680h. The displacement is 0x00801680 - 0x008061C6 - 5 (since E8 is a 4-byte displacement). Wait, the displacement is 0x00801680 - 0x008061C6 - 5 (since the call is at 008061C6, and the displacement is relative to the next instruction). Let me not get bogged down here. The key is to use wildcards for the addresses. So the pattern would be B9 42 8C 80 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 10 bytes. That's acceptable. But maybe the user wants patterns that are more specific to evasion points. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the je instructions. For example, the first je is at 0080618A: 0F8433FDFFFF. The previous instruction is call 0080667Fh. So combining those two instructions: E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but the call's offset is 0080667Fh, which is 4 bytes. Then the je instruction is 0F84 followed by 4 bytes. So the pattern would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??, which is 12 bytes. That's another possible pattern. \n\nBut the user wants three different patterns. Let me choose three distinct ones. Let me pick the three I first thought of: the push ebx followed by call, push eax followed by call, and xor ecx, ecx followed by call. Each is 8 bytes. Let me check if they are all different. \n\nFirst pattern: 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061F7 and 008061F8)\nSecond pattern: 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061F0 and 008061F1)\nThird pattern: 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061E2 and 008061E7)\n\nYes, these are different. Now, let me make sure that each pattern is between 6-20 bytes. All are 8 bytes, which is acceptable. \n\nAnother possibility is to take the test eax, eax followed by je. For example, the first two instructions are 85 C0 74 12. But the je has a 4-byte offset. So the pattern would be 85 C0 74 12 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but the offset is 0x12, which is 0x00000012. Wait, the je at 0080617C is 74 12, which is je 00806190h. The offset is 12 (0x12). So the pattern would be 85 C0 74 12 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but the je instruction is 74 12, which is 2 bytes. Wait, the je instruction is 0x74 followed by a 1-byte offset. Wait, no: the je instruction is 0x74 followed by a 1-byte displacement. Wait, in x86, the je instruction (0x74) has a 1-byte displacement. So the instruction is 74 12, where 12 is the offset. So the pattern would be 85 C0 74 12 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but the displacement is 0x12, which is part of the instruction. Wait, no, the displacement is part of the instruction. So if I take the previous instruction (85 C0) and the je instruction (74 12), then the pattern would be 85 C0 74 12, which is 6 bytes. But the displacement is part of the je instruction. However, the user wants to use wildcards for addresses. Wait, in this case, the je instruction's displacement is 0x12, which is part of the instruction. So if I include that, it's concrete. But maybe the user wants to use wildcards for addresses. Wait, the displacement in the je instruction is relative to the next instruction. So in this case, the je is at 0080617C, and the target is 00806190h. The displacement is 0x14 (since 0x6190 - 0x617C = 0x14). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check. The je instruction at 0080617C (address 0x0080617C) has an operand of 0x12. The next instruction is at 0x0080617D. So the displacement is 0x12 (0x00000012). So the target address is 0x0080617C + 0x00000002 (length of je instruction) + 0x12 = 0x0080617C + 0x00000014 = 0x00806190. So the displacement is 0x14. Wait, but the instruction is 74 12, which is 0x74 followed by 0x12. So the displacement is 0x12. But that's not the actual offset. Wait, perhaps the displacement is stored as a signed byte. So 0x12 is 18 in decimal, but since it's a signed byte, it's 18. But the actual offset is 0x14 (20). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The point is, the displacement is part of the instruction. So if I include that, it's concrete. But the user wants to use wildcards for addresses. So maybe I should not include the displacement in the pattern. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\". So any address or offset in the instruction should be replaced with ??.\n\nIn the je instruction (0F84...), the offset is part of the instruction. So for example, the instruction at 0080618A is 0F8433FDFFFF. The 0F84 is the opcode for je, and the next four bytes are the 32-bit offset. So in that case, the pattern would be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but that's 6 bytes). However, the user wants to capture the entire instruction. Wait, the je instruction is 0F84 followed by a 4-byte displacement. So the entire instruction is 5 bytes. But if I take the previous instruction (call) and the je instruction, that would be 5 + 4 = 9 bytes. But the call instruction is E8 followed by 4 bytes. For example, the call at 0080618A is E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but wait, the call is at 0080618A? Let me check the original data.\n\nLooking back, the original data has:\n\nAt 0080618A: 0F8433FDFFFF (je instruction)\nPrevious instruction is E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (call instruction). Wait, no. Let me check the original trace:\n\nLooking at the original data:\n\nThe user provided:\n\n# Original trace data (example):\n\nAt 0080617C: 74 12 (je 00806190h)\nAt 0080618A: 0F8433FDFFFF (je instruction with offset 0x33FDFFFF)\n\nWait, perhaps the first je is at 0080617C, and the second je is at 0080618A. So the first je is 74 12, and the second is 0F84 followed by 4 bytes. So if I take the first je instruction (74 12) and the previous instruction (call), that would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 12. But that's 9 bytes. However, the displacement in the call instruction is part of the address. So the pattern would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 74 12, which is 9 bytes. But the user wants to use wildcards for addresses. So the call's displacement is replaced with ??, and the je's displacement is 12, which is concrete. Wait, but the je's displacement is part of the instruction. So if the displacement is 12, that's concrete. But the user wants to replace all address/offset bytes with ??, so maybe the displacement in the je instruction should be replaced with ?? as well. Wait, the displacement in the je instruction is part of the instruction's operand. So if I include that, it's part of the instruction. But the user wants to replace any address/offset bytes with ??.\n\nSo, for example, in the je instruction (0F8433FDFFFF), the 33FDFFFF is the offset. So in the pattern, those bytes should be replaced with ??, and the opcode 0F84 is concrete. So the pattern would be 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (6 bytes). But that's only the je instruction. However, if I combine it with the previous instruction, which is a call, then the pattern would be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? (but that's 12 bytes). But I'm not sure. Maybe the user wants patterns that are specific to the evasion points. \n\nIn any case, the three patterns I first thought of are valid. Let me confirm that they are all different and meet the requirements. \n\nFirst pattern: 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061F7 and 008061F8)\nSecond pattern: 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061F0 and 008061F1)\nThird pattern: 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (from 008061E2 and 008061E7)\n\nYes, these are three different patterns. Each is 8 bytes, and they use wildcards for the addresses. The opcodes are concrete. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third pattern could be longer. For example, taking the previous instruction (B9 42 8C 80 00) and the call (E8 ...). But that would be 5 + 4 = 9 bytes. However, the B9 instruction is part of the mov ecx, imm32. So the pattern would be B9 42 8C 80 00 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? (10 bytes). But that's also acceptable. \n\nBut the user wants exactly three patterns. Let me stick with the first three I found. \n\nSo the final answer would be three patterns:\n\npattern0: 53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??\npattern1: 50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??\npattern2: 33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??\n\nEach is 8 bytes. Now, I need to make sure that each pattern is correctly formatted with spaces between hex bytes and wrapped in { }.\n\nSo:\n\npattern0: {53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??}\npattern1: {50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??}\npattern2: {33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n\nThese are three different patterns, each between 6-20 bytes, using wildcards for addresses, and keeping opcodes concrete. This should meet the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n```plaintext\n{53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??} {50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??} {33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Patterns:**\n\n1. **Pattern0:** `{53 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??}`  \n   - **Address:** 008061F7 (push ebx) → 008061F8 (call to ExitProcess).  \n   - **Wildcard:** The memory address of the `call` instruction is replaced with `??` to capture evasion behavior.\n\n2. **Pattern1:** `{50 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??}`  \n   - **Address:** 008061F0 (push eax) → 008061F1 (call to a target).  \n   - **Wildcard:** The `call` instruction's address is abstracted with `??`.\n\n3. **Pattern2:** `{33 C9 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}`  \n   - **Address:** 008061E2 (xor ecx, ecx) → 008061E3 (call to a target).  \n   - **Wildcard:** The `call` instruction's address is replaced with `??` to generalize evasion patterns.\n\n**Cape:** All patterns use `??` for address/offset bytes, ensuring flexibility while retaining opcode specificity for accurate detection.",

      "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt likely failed due to overly generic patterns or incorrect targeting of evasion checks. By focusing on concrete test/je sequences and the ExitProcess call from the original trace, we increase specificity and reduce false positives. The three patterns capture key evasion checks and exit triggers, aligning with Strategy A (evasion checks) and B (exit decision).  \n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 95  \n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target critical evasion checks (test eax, eax + je) and the ExitProcess call, which are likely used to bypass detection. Using exact bytes from the trace ensures accuracy while wildcards allow flexibility for offsets.  \n\n**YARA_RULE**:  \n```yara  \nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved  \n{  \n    meta:  \n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"  \n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"  \n\n    strings:  \n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? } // Test + je + call (first evasion check)  \n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC } // Test + je + mov (second evasion check)  \n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? } // ExitProcess call (exit decision trigger)  \n\n    condition:  \n        any of them  \n}  \n```",

    "raw_response": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt likely failed due to overly generic patterns or incorrect targeting of evasion checks. By focusing on concrete test/je sequences and the ExitProcess call from the original trace, we increase specificity and reduce false positives. The three patterns capture key evasion checks and exit triggers, aligning with Strategy A (evasion checks) and B (exit decision).  \n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 95  \n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target critical evasion checks (test eax, eax + je) and the ExitProcess call, which are likely used to bypass detection. Using exact bytes from the trace ensures accuracy while wildcards allow flexibility for offsets.  \n\n**YARA_RULE**:  \n```yara  \nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved  \n{  \n    meta:  \n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"  \n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"  \n\n    strings:  \n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 74 12 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? } // Test + je + call (first evasion check)  \n        $pattern1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC } // Test + je + mov (second evasion check)  \n        $pattern2 = { FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ?? } // ExitProcess call (exit decision trigger)  \n\n    condition:  \n        any of them  \n}  \n```",
