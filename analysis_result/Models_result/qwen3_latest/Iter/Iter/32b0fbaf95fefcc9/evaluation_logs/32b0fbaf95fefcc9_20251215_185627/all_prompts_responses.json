      "response_text": "To detect and bypass the evasion mechanism in the provided code snippet, we can create a YARA rule that identifies the presence of specific instruction sequences that are indicative of a call to `ExitProcess`, which is commonly used as a way to terminate a process in a sandboxed environment.

The `call` instructions point to functions like `ExitProcess` or `___crtCorExitProcess`, which are often used to terminate the current process or to escape from a sandbox. By detecting these calls, we can identify potential evasion attempts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Bypassing the Evasion**\n\nTo bypass this detection, one could modify the code to skip the `call` instruction, for example by replacing it with a `nop` or a `jmp` to a different part of the code. This would prevent the process from terminating and would avoid triggering the detection rule.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 **Final Answer**\n\n```yara\nrule EvasionDetection {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects evasion via call to ExitProcess\"\n    strings:\n        $a = {55 8B EC FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n        $b = {59 FF 75 08 FF 15 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n        $c = {FF 75 08 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??}\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\n\\text{YARA Rule: EvasionDetection with three patterns to detect call to ExitProcess}\n}\n$$",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

      "response_text": "**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous rule caused a crash due to targeting the wrong location. The feedback emphasizes directly targeting the ExitProcess call and using more context bytes. The original trace shows that ExitProcess is called at 00427B1A with opcode FF15. By capturing the surrounding instructions (e.g., push ebp, mov ebp, esp) and the call itself with wildcards for address bytes, the rule avoids false positives while remaining specific enough to hit the target. Three distinct patterns are selected from the trace to cover different parts of the execution flow.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 75\n\n**REASONING**: These patterns target the function prologue (push ebp/mov ebp), the push before the ExitProcess call, and the call itself. Using wildcards for address bytes ensures flexibility across variants while maintaining specificity to avoid incorrect matches. This approach aligns with the feedback to focus on the actual ExitProcess call and its context.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects ExitProcess call with contextual prologue\"\n        author = \"AI\"\n        date = \"2023-10-15\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = {55 8B EC} // Function prologue\n        $b = {FF7508 FF15 ?? ?? ?? ??} // Push + call (address flexible)\n        $c = {FF15 ?? ?? ?? ??} // Direct ExitProcess call (address flexible)\n\n    condition:\n        all of ($a, $b, $c)\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3.

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

The trace shows two exit-related calls: one to ___crtCorExitProcess and another to ExitProcess.

By using concrete byte sequences (without wildcards), they minimize false positives while still capturing the critical decision points in the sample's execution.

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.
