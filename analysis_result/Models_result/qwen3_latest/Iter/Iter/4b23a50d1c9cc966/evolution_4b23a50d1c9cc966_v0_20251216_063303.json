The evasion logic is in earlier checks (CMP EAX, 01h + JE/JNE) and conditional flow. I'll focus on **STRATEGY A** (evasion check) and **STRATEGY B** (exit decision) by extracting concrete byte sequences from the trace. Patterns are chosen from the first 30% of the trace (evasion check) and the exit decision logic.\n\n---\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE  \n**CONFIDENCE**: 75  \n**REASONING**: This pattern targets the evasion check logic (CMP EAX, 01h + JE) at the start of the trace. It's specific to the sample's flow and avoids matching unrelated calls. The concrete bytes ensure accuracy while allowing for offset variations.  \n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CMP_SETZ  \n**CONFIDENCE**: 65  \n**REASONING**: This pattern captures the second evasion check (TEST AL, 01h + JNE) in the trace. It's a unique flow that likely validates process integrity. Using exact bytes from the trace ensures specificity without overgeneralization.  \n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: EXIT_CALL  \n**CONFIDENCE**: 60  \n**REASONING**: This pattern targets the ExitProcess call at the end of the flow. While not an evasion check, it's critical for bypassing the final decision. The concrete bytes ensure it's tied to this specific sample's behavior.  \n\n---\n\n**YARA Rule**:  \n```yara\nrule Sample_Evasion_Check\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Targeting evasion checks and exit logic in the sample\"\n    strings:\n        $a = { E8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 74 20 } // CALL + CMP EAX, 01h + JE\n        $b = { C1 E8 08 A8 01 75 10 } // SHR EAX + TEST AL, 01h + JNE\n        $c = { FF 15 A0 F1 42 00 } // ExitProcess call\n    condition:\n        all of ($a, $b, $c)\n}\n```\n\nThis rule ensures precise detection of the sample's evasion logic and exit path, avoiding false positives by anchoring to exact byte sequences.",

      "raw_response": "To effectively detect the behavior of the code in question, we should focus on the **decision points** rather than the **exit actions** themselves. The code appears to perform a series of checks and conditional jumps before ultimately calling `ExitProcess`. The goal is to identify these decision-making steps, which are more likely to be unique and less likely to be found in unrelated code.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Three Key Patterns Identified**\n\nHere are three distinct and meaningful byte sequences that represent **decision logic** within the code flow:\n\n#### 1. **Initial Check Logic**\nThis pattern captures the initial conditional check that determines the flow of execution:\n```assembly\nE8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 74 20\n```\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - `E8 F7 25 00 00` → `call` to an offset (likely a check function)\n  - `83 F8 01` → `cmp eax, 0x01` (compare EAX with 1)\n  - `74 20` → `je 0x20` (jump if equal, to a potential exit point)\n\nThis pattern identifies the **initial decision logic** that may be used to determine whether to proceed to an exit or continue processing.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Terminate Process Logic**\nThis pattern captures the logic that leads to calling `TerminateProcess`:\n```assembly\nFF 15 3C F1 42 00 50 FF 15 40 F1 42 00\n```\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - `FF 15 3C F1 42 00` → `call` to `GetCurrentProcess` (likely a pointer to the API)\n  - `50` → `push eax` (pushing the result of `GetCurrentProcess`)\n  - `FF 15 40 F1 42 00` → `call` to `TerminateProcess` (another API call)\n\nThis sequence represents the **logic that leads to termination** and is likely unique to this code.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Exit Process Logic**\nThis pattern captures the final step before calling `ExitProcess`:\n```assembly\nFF 75 08 FF 15 A0 F1 42 00\n```\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - `FF 75 08` → `push [ebp+0x08]` (pushing a value from the stack)\n  - `FF 15 A0 F1 42 00` → `call` to `ExitProcess`\n\nThis pattern identifies the **final step before exiting**, which is a good indicator of the program’s intent to terminate.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final YARA Rule (Example)**\n\n```yara\nrule ExitDecisionLogic\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects code that leads to termination via ExitProcess or TerminateProcess\"\n        author = \"YourName\"\n        date = \"2025-04-05\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = { E8 F7 25 00 00 83 F8 01 74 20 }\n        $b = { FF 15 3C F1 42 00 50 FF 15 40 F1 42 00 }\n        $c = { FF 75 08 FF 15 A0 F1 42 00 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 📌 **Why This Works**\n\n- These patterns are **specific to the code logic** and not generic API calls.\n- They target **decision points**, which are more likely to be unique and not found in other contexts.\n- This approach is more robust than simply detecting `ExitProcess`, which is a common function and may appear in many unrelated programs.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to expand this into a full detection system or add more context!",
