      "raw_response": "To bypass the call to `ExitProcess` (or its equivalent in the target environment), the critical point is the instruction at `0041B93C` that executes the exit. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Identify the Target Instruction**\nThe call to `ExitProcess` is located at memory address `0041B93C`. This instruction is likely the final step in the program's execution, terminating the process.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Bypass the Call via Code Modification**\n- **NOP (No Operation):** Replace the `call ExitProcess` instruction with a `NOP` (e.g., `0x90`). This effectively skips the exit call.\n  - **Example:**  \n    ```asm\n    ; Original:\n    call [0042F1A0]  ; ExitProcess\n\n    ; Modified:\n    nop\n    ```\n- **JMP to Alternate Code:** Redirect the flow to a different part of the program (e.g., a loop or a clean exit) using a `jmp` instruction.\n  - **Example:**  \n    ```asm\n    jmp [0041B950]  ; Jump to a safe location\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Use a Debugger to Modify Execution**\n- **Break on the Call:** Use a debugger (e.g., x64dbg, IDA Pro, GDB) to break on the `call ExitProcess` instruction.\n- **Modify the Instruction:** Once paused, change the `call` to a `nop` or redirect the flow using a `jmp`.\n- **Automate with Scripts:** Tools like Cheat Engine or Python scripts with `pydbg` can automate this process.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Hook or Intercept the Exit Call**\n- **Detour the Function:** Use a hook (e.g., with Detours or Frida) to intercept the `ExitProcess` call and redirect it to a custom handler.\n  - **Example (Frida):**\n    ```javascript\n    Interceptor.attach(ptr(\"0041B93C\"), {\n        onEnter: function(args) {\n            console.log(\"Bypassing ExitProcess\");\n            // Optionally, modify registers or jump to another address\n        }\n    });\n    ```\n- **Patch the Function Pointer:** If `ExitProcess` is called via a function pointer, redirect the pointer to a stub that does nothing.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Bypass Conditional Logic**\nIf the call to `ExitProcess` is conditional (e.g., based on a flag), modify the condition to avoid triggering the exit:\n- **Modify a Flag:** Change the value of a variable that determines whether the exit is executed.\n- **Alter Control Flow:** Use a `jmp` to skip the conditional check.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Use Anti-Debugging Bypass**\nIf the program detects a debugger, ensure the `ExitProcess` call is not triggered by:\n- **Disabling Debug Breakpoints:** Use `IsDebuggerPresent` checks and bypass them.\n- **Fake Process Termination:** Redirect the exit call to a harmless routine.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThe core strategy is to **prevent the `ExitProcess` call** from executing. This can be achieved by:\n1. **Modifying the instruction** directly (NOP, JMP).\n2. **Intercepting the call** with a debugger or hook.\n3. **Bypassing conditional logic** that leads to the call.\n4. **Redirecting execution** to a safe location.\n\n**Note:** The exact method depends on the target environment, protections (e.g., ASLR, CFG), and the context of the program. Always ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.",

These sequences are extracted directly from the disassembled code, ensuring high specificity and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 0: Conditional Jump on EAX Comparison**\n\nThis pattern identifies a conditional jump (`JE`) that depends on whether the value of `EAX` is equal to `0x01`. This is a typical indicator of a simple evasion check.\n\n- **Bytes**: `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 F8 01 74 20`\n- **Explanation**:\n  - `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` is a `CALL` instruction to an external function (likely the start of the evasion logic).\n  - `83 F8 01` is `CMP EAX, 0x01`.\n  - `74 20` is `JE` to the address `0x20` bytes ahead, indicating a conditional branch if the comparison was equal.\n\n- **Length**: 14 bytes\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 1: Conditional Jump on AL Test**\n\nThis pattern identifies a conditional jump (`JNE`) that depends on whether the lowest 8 bits of `AL` (the lower byte of `EAX`) is non-zero. This could be used to test for a flag or state.\n\n- **Bytes**: `C1E808 A8 01 75 10`\n- **Explanation**:\n  - `C1E808` is `SHR EAX, 0x08` (shifts the value of `EAX` right by 8 bits).\n  - `A8 01` is `TEST AL, 0x01` (checks if the least significant bit of `AL` is set).\n  - `75 10` is `JNE` to the address `0x10` bytes ahead.\n\n- **Length**: 8 bytes\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Pattern 2: TerminateProcess Call with Argument Push**\n\nThis pattern identifies a call to `TerminateProcess` with an argument pushed from `EAX`, which is a typical exit mechanism in Windows.\n\n- **Bytes**: `50 FF1540F14200`\n- **Explanation**:\n  - `50` is `PUSH EAX` (pushes the argument to the stack).\n  - `FF1540F14200` is a `CALL` to `TerminateProcess` at offset `0x42F140`.\n\n- **Length**: 10 bytes\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Why These Patterns Work**\n\nEach of these patterns is carefully chosen to capture different aspects of the control flow:\n- **Pattern 0** checks for a simple condition on `EAX`.\n- **Pattern 1** tests for a flag using `AL` and a conditional jump.\n- **Pattern 2** is a direct call to `TerminateProcess`, which is used to terminate the current process—often in the context of a kill switch or exit logic.\n\nThese patterns are **not** part of the exit mechanism itself, but rather the **preconditions** or **checks** that may be used to control the execution flow.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Final YARA Rule (Simplified Version)**\n\n```yara\nrule Malicious_Control_Flow\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Detects evasion checks and termination logic\"\n        author = \"Your Name\"\n        date = \"2025-03-20\"\n\n    strings:\n        $a = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 F8 01 74 20 }\n        $b = { C1E808 A8 01 75 10 }\n        $c = { 50 FF1540F14200 }\n\n    condition:\n        all of ($a or $b or $c)\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Summary\n\nBy leveraging these **specific control-flow patterns**, you can accurately identify the presence of evasion logic or termination behavior in the target code.

      "raw_response": " ??<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this YARA bypass rule evolution. The user is trying to bypass detection for a specific malware sample, and their previous attempts resulted in \"rule hit but no new signatures.\" The main issue seems to be that the patterns matched the wrong location or weren't specific enough.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the original trace provided. The key part is the ExitProcess call at address 0041B93C. The user's previous rule didn't find any new signatures, so the patterns might not have targeted the right area. \n\nThe task suggests three strategies: A (evasion check in the first 30% of the trace), B (exit decision before the exit call), and C (specific evasion techniques). Since the previous attempt hit the rule but didn't find new signatures, maybe the patterns were too generic or in the wrong location.\n\nLooking at the trace, the first few instructions include a call to 0041DF02h, then a cmp eax, 01h followed by je. This seems like an evasion check. Strategy A focuses on CALL → TEST EAX → JE/JNE. The instruction at 0041B90B is cmp eax, 01h, then je 0041B930h. So maybe targeting this part would be better.\n\nAnother part is the call to ExitProcess at 0041B93C. Strategy B suggests checking before the exit call. The instructions before that include pushing parameters and calling TerminateProcess. Maybe there's a conditional check there.\n\nAlso, looking for unique instruction sequences. The instruction at 0041B91C is shr eax, 08h, followed by test al, 01h. That could be a specific pattern.\n\nSo, the user needs three different patterns from the trace. Let's extract the relevant parts:\n\n1. The cmp eax, 01h followed by je. The bytes here are 83 F8 01 74 20. That's a cmp and je, which fits Strategy A.\n\n2. The call to TerminateProcess at 0041B92A, which is FF 15 40 F1 42 00. This is an API check, so Strategy B could use this.\n\n3. The shr eax, 08h and test al, 01h. The bytes here are C1 E8 08 A8 01. This is a specific sequence, maybe part of a check.\n\nEach pattern needs to be 6-20 bytes. Let's check the exact bytes from the trace:\n\nFor pattern0: The cmp and je is at 0041B90B-0041B91E. The bytes are 83 F8 01 74 20. Wait, the instruction at 0041B90B is cmp eax, 01h (83 F8 01), then je 0041B930h (74 20). So the pattern would be 83 F8 01 74 20. That's 5 bytes, but maybe include more to make it 6-20. Let's see the surrounding instructions. The next instruction after je is push dword ptr [ebp+08h] (FF 75 08). Maybe include that? But the user said to use exact bytes from the trace. Let me check the exact bytes in the trace:\n\nLooking at the original trace's instructions:\n\nAddress 0041B90B: cmp eax, 01h → opcode 83 F8 01\nThen je 0041B930h → opcode 74 20 (since 0x20 is 32 in hex, which is the offset from the current instruction). So the pattern would be 83 F8 01 74 20. That's 5 bytes, but maybe include the next instruction? Wait, the je is 74 20, which is 2 bytes. So the pattern would be 83 F8 01 74 20 (5 bytes). But the user requires 6-20 bytes. Maybe expand to include more instructions. Let's check the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is the call to the check function. The call at 0041B906 is E8 F7 25 00 00. That's a call instruction with a relative offset. Since the offset is part of the call, it's variable, so using ?? for the address. So the pattern could be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? followed by the cmp and je. But the user wants patterns from the trace, so maybe the call instruction itself is part of the pattern.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"All patterns MUST come from the original trace above! Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA.\" So I can't invent bytes. So the call at 0041B906 is E8 F7 25 00 00. But the exact bytes are E8 F7 25 00 00. However, the offset (F7250000) might vary in different samples, so using ?? for the address part. So the pattern could be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? followed by the cmp and je. But the user wants patterns from the trace, so maybe the call instruction is part of the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern could be the cmp and je, which are 83 F8 01 74 20. That's 5 bytes. But the user requires 6-20 bytes. Maybe include the previous instruction? The call at 0041B906 is E8 F7 25 00 00. So the pattern could be E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 F8 01 74 20. That's 10 bytes. That's a possible pattern.\n\nAnother pattern is the call to TerminateProcess at 0041B92A: FF 15 40 F1 42 00. That's 6 bytes. So the pattern could be FF 15 40 F1 42 00. That's a specific API check.\n\nThird pattern could be the shr and test: C1 E8 08 A8 01. That's 5 bytes. Maybe expand to include more instructions. For example, the instruction before shr is mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h] (8B 40 68). So the pattern could be 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01. That's 8 bytes.\n\nPutting it all together, the three patterns would be:\n\n1. E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 F8 01 74 20 (call followed by cmp and je)\n2. FF 15 40 F1 42 00 (call to TerminateProcess)\n3. 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01 (mov, shr, test)\n\nThese patterns target different parts of the trace, covering evasion checks, API calls, and specific instruction sequences. They are specific enough to match the target but not too restrictive. The use of ?? for addresses allows for variations. This should help in bypassing detection by targeting the evasion checks and exit decisions as per the strategies.\n</think>\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous attempt matched the wrong location, likely focusing on the exit call itself rather than the decision logic. The new patterns target the evasion check (cmp+je) in the first 30% of the trace (Strategy A), the API call to TerminateProcess (Strategy B), and a unique instruction sequence involving shr/test (Strategy C). These patterns are specific to the trace but allow for variations via wildcards, reducing false positives.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK, OTHER\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 85\n\n**REASONING**: The first pattern targets the evasion check logic (cmp+je) which is critical for bypassing detection. The second pattern focuses on the API call to TerminateProcess, which is a common exit mechanism. The third pattern captures a unique sequence involving register manipulation (shr/test), which is less likely to be present in other samples. These patterns collectively cover evasion checks, exit decisions, and unique instruction sequences, increasing the likelihood of hitting the target while avoiding false positives.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 F8 01 74 20 }  // CALL + CMP+JE evasion check\n        $pattern1 = { FF 15 40 F1 42 00 }                // TerminateProcess API call\n        $pattern2 = { 8B 40 68 C1 E8 08 A8 01 }          // Unique register manipulation sequence\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
