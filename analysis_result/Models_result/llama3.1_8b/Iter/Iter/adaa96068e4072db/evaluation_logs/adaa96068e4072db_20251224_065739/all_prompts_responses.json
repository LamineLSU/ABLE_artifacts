(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",
      "response_text": "Based on the provided trace data and reasoning strategy, I will analyze the malware execution trace from both attacker and defender perspectives.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nThe attacker is trying to detect sandbox/VM/debugger analysis tools. The evasion checks are likely implemented to identify specific patterns or behaviors that indicate the presence of these tools.\n\nUpon analyzing the trace, I notice that the malware author has implemented a series of conditional jumps and tests to detect potential analysis tools. Specifically:\n\n- Check 1: `FFD0` at address `0041E86B` is a call instruction that loads the EAX register with the value stored in the ESP register. This could be used to check for debugger presence.\n- Check 2: The sequence of instructions starting from `6A36` and ending with `C3` (at addresses `0041E844` to `0041E86F`) seems to perform a series of checks, possibly related to memory layout or other indicators of analysis tools.\n- Check 3: The instruction `FFD2` at address `0041E832` is another call instruction that loads the EDX register with the value stored in the ESI register. This could be used to check for sandbox/VM presence.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nAs a defender, I aim to bypass these evasion checks and continue execution. Upon analyzing the trace, I identify potential bypass points:\n\n- Target 1: If I skip the instruction at address `0041E86B` (`FFD0`), the attacker's first check is neutralized because it relies on loading the EAX register with the value stored in ESP.\n- Target 2: If I skip the sequence of instructions starting from `6A36` (at addresses `0041E844` to `0041E86F`), the second check is bypassed because it seems to perform a series of checks related to memory layout or other indicators of analysis tools.\n- Target 3: If I skip the instruction at address `0041E832` (`FFD2`), the third check is avoided because it relies on loading the EDX register with the value stored in ESI.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsidering the robustness of each bypass, I conclude that:\n\n- Bypassing the first target (skipping `FFD0`) might be easily detectable by the attacker, as it directly affects the execution flow.\n- Bypassing the second target (skipping the sequence starting from `6A36`) could be more challenging for the attacker to detect, but may still be possible through reverse-engineering or code analysis.\n- Bypassing the third target (skipping `FFD2`) seems to have a higher chance of success, as it relies on loading a register with a value that might not be directly related to the evasion checks.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on the adversarial analysis, I select the following three DIFFERENT bypass targets:\n\n1. Skipping `FFD0` at address `0041E86B`\n2. Skipping the sequence starting from `6A36` (at addresses `0041E844` to `0041E86F`)\n3. Skipping `FFD2` at address `0041E832`\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, I combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards:\n\n1. **Pattern 1:** `FF D0 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??` (6 bytes)\n2. **Pattern 2:** `6A 36 ?? ?? ???? 8B C4 ??` (11 bytes)\n3. **Pattern 3:** `FF D2 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??` (6 bytes)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern1+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern2+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern3+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern1 = { [FF D0 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6A 36 ?? ?? ???? 8B C4 ??] }\n        $pattern3 = { [FF D2 ?? ?? ?? ?? ??] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

and create the final rule.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

      "response_text": "Here is the solution to generate a YARA bypass rule:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Trace Data\n\nThe given trace data shows a malware execution that terminates early due to sandbox/VM evasion.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Suspicious Evasion Points\n\nFrom the provided code snippet, we can identify several suspicious evasion points, such as:\n- CALL/JMP instructions with unknown offsets\n- Conditional jumps with unknown offsets\n- Memory address bytes and stack offsets\n\n### Step 3: Extract Patterns\n\nTo create a YARA bypass rule, we need to extract three different patterns that target these suspicious evasion points. We will combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern.\n\n**Pattern 1:** `$pattern0 = { 8B 45 ?? 83 C4 08 52 50 FFD2 }`\n\nThis pattern includes a CALL instruction with an unknown offset (8B 45 ??), followed by MOV, ADD ESP, PUSH, and CALL instructions. The surrounding context helps to make this pattern specific.\n\n**Pattern 2:** `$pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 08 52 50 }`\n\nThis pattern includes a JMP instruction with an unknown offset (E8 ?? ?? ?? ??), followed by ADD ESP, PUSH, and CALL instructions. Again, the surrounding context helps to make this pattern specific.\n\n**Pattern 3:** `$pattern2 = { 6A 00 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }`\n\nThis pattern includes a PUSH instruction (6A 00), followed by POP, MOV, CALL, and JMP instructions. The unknown offset after the CALL instruction is replaced with `??`.\n\n### Step 4: Format YARA Bypass Rule\n\nHere's the formatted YARA bypass rule:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 45 ?? 83 C4 08 52 50 FFD2 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 83 C4 08 52 50 }\n        $pattern2 = { 6A 00 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\nNote that the `cape_options` field references each pattern as `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, and `$pattern2`. The `count=0` option ensures that at least one of these patterns must match before triggering the bypass.",

      "response_text": "To solve this problem, I will follow the reasoning strategy provided:\n\n### Phase 1: Establish the factual outcome\n\n- The program exits (this is the observed fact)\n- Identify the exact instruction sequence leading to exit\n\nThe instruction sequence leading to exit is:\n```assembly\n0041E86B  FFD0             call eax\n```\nThis instruction calls a function pointed to by `eax`.\n\n### Phase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses\n\nFor each suspicious instruction, ask:\n\n* \"What if this instruction were skipped?\"\n* \"Would the program continue instead of exiting?\"\n\nLet's analyze the instructions around the exit point:\n```assembly\n0041E86B  FFD0             call eax\n```\nThis instruction calls a function pointed to by `eax`. We can assume that the function being called is responsible for the early termination.\n\n### Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis\n\nFor each candidate instruction:\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* [Instruction at line X]\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit?\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit?\n\nSince the `call eax` instruction is responsible for the early termination, skipping it might allow the program to continue executing.\n\n### Phase 4: Select the 3 best bypass points\n\nChoose instructions where skipping is likely SUFFICIENT to bypass evasion.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can select the following bypass points:\n\n*   Bypass point 1: `call eax` (0041E86B)\n*   Bypass point 2: The instruction that sets the value of `eax` before the `call eax` instruction.\n*   Bypass point 3: The instruction that jumps to the exit point.\n\n### Phase 5: Build patterns\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\nHere are the three patterns:\n\nPattern 1:\n```assembly\nFFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? \n```\nThis pattern includes the `call eax` instruction (0041E86B) and applies wildcards to the bytes that follow.\n\nPattern 2:\n```assembly\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? FFD0 \n```\nThis pattern includes the instruction that sets the value of `eax` before the `call eax` instruction and applies a wildcard to the byte after the `FFD0`.\n\nPattern 3:\n```assembly\n?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? \n```\nThis pattern includes the jump instruction that leads to the exit point.\n\n### Pattern Length Requirement\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long**. We have created three patterns, each with a length of at least 6 bytes.\n\n### Wildcard Rules\n\nWe applied wildcards to address and offset bytes in the patterns.\n\n### Output Format\n\nHere is the Yara rule that includes the three bypass points:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta: \n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { FFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2\n\n---\n\n## CORRECTION GUIDE\n\nBased on the validation errors above, generate a NEW corrected YARA rule.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST FOLLOW)\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options in meta section for bypass to work\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **WILDCARDS REQUIRED**: Replace address/offset bytes with `??` wildcards\n\n### Common Errors and How to Fix Them\n\n| Error Type | Problem | Solution |\n|------------|---------|----------|\n| **\"too short\"** | Pattern has < 6 bytes | Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions into one pattern.
