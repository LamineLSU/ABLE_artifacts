E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\nThis pattern is taken from the instruction `PUSH EAX` followed by `CALL [EAX]`. The `EAX` register is pushed onto the stack, and then the address in `EAX` is called. This sequence is suspicious as it may be used for evasion.\n\n**Pattern 2:**\n`8B 45 ?? FF D0 ?? ?? E9 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\nThis pattern is taken from the instruction `MOV EAX, [EBP+??]` followed by a conditional jump. The `EBP` register is loaded with an address, and then a conditional jump is performed based on the value in `EAX`. This sequence may be used for evasion to bypass security checks.\n\n**Pattern 3:**\n`C7 44 ?? ?? ?? ?? B8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\nThis pattern is taken from the instruction `MOV [ESP+??], EAX` followed by a CALL instruction. The `EAX` register is loaded into memory at an address pointed to by `ESP`, and then a CALL instruction is executed. This sequence may be used for evasion to bypass security checks.\n\nHere is the YARA rule that matches these patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 50 FF D5 ?? ?? ?? ??
