By focusing on the call-test-je sequence, we increase our chances of detecting variants that use this technique.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B 4D FC 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nIn this evolved rule, I've selected three different patterns that target the evasion check function. Each pattern is based on a unique sequence found in the original trace and meets the required specificity and length criteria.\n\n* `$pattern0` targets the call-test-je sequence with a specific offset (`8B 4D FC 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??`)\n* `$pattern1` targets a cmp-je sequence with concrete bytes (`83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8`)\n* `$pattern2` targets a cmp-eax-imm32-jb sequence with a specific comparison value (`3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82`)\n\nThese patterns should provide better detection capabilities for variants of the malware evasion technique.",
