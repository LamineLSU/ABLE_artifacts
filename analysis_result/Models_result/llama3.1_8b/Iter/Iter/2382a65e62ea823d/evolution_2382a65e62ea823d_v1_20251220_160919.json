However, for the sake of this exercise, I will focus on creating a bypass pattern around the `FFD0` instruction at address `0041E1EF`.\n\nThe `FFD0` instruction is a call to eax, which likely contains a function pointer or an address that leads to another part of the code. Tracing backwards, we can see several instructions that may be related to this call.\n\n**Step 2: Select 3 different bypass candidates**\n\nBased on my analysis, I will choose three potential bypass candidates:\n\n1. The `52` instruction at address `0041E1AF`, which pushes edx onto the stack.\n2. The `8B16` instruction at address `0041E1B0`, which moves a value from [esi] into edx.\n3. The `50` instruction at address `0041E1B2`, which pushes eax onto the stack.\n\n**Step 3: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nI will combine each bypass candidate with adjacent instructions to create three unique patterns:\n\nPattern 1:\n```hex\n52 8B16 50 FFD0\n```\nThis pattern includes the `52` instruction, followed by the `8B16` instruction, and then the `50` instruction. The final byte is the `FFD0` call to eax.\n\nPattern 2:\n```hex\n52 FFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B16 50\n```\nThis pattern includes the `52` instruction, followed by a potential wildcard sequence (to account for variations in code), and then the `FFD0` call to eax. The final bytes are the `8B16` and `50` instructions.\n\nPattern 3:\n```hex\n8B16 FFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 50 52\n```\nThis pattern includes the `8B16` instruction, followed by the `FFD0` call to eax, and then a potential wildcard sequence. The final bytes are the `50` and `52` instructions.\n\n**Step 4: Apply wildcards and generate the YARA rule**\n\nI will replace address/offset bytes with `??` and create the final rule:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B16 50 FFD0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 52 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B16 50 FFD0 }\n        $pattern2 = { 8B16 FFD0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 50 52 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\nThis YARA rule includes three bypass patterns, each with a potential wildcard sequence to account for variations in code. The `cape_options` section specifies the action to take when any of these patterns are matched: skip the instruction at address 0.\n\nI hope this meets all your requirements! Let me know if you need further assistance.",
