Our previous attempt failed due to \"Failed to submit sample\", which suggests that we need to be more generic and account for slight variations in instruction sequences.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\nWe will use a combination of pattern types, focusing on CALL_TEST_JE (to target the check function), API_CHECK (to identify conditional logic before exit), and TIMING_CHECK (to detect evasion techniques like RDTSC timing).\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\nWe are confident that these evolved patterns will improve our chances of bypassing the malware evasion technique, with a confidence level of 80%.\n\n**REASONING**:\nOur reasoning is based on the analysis of the original trace, which shows two exit-related instructions (0040E7F6 and 0040E7FF). We have identified three potential bypass points: the check function (CALL → TEST EAX → JE/JNE), conditional logic before exit (Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess), and evasion techniques like RDTSC timing.
