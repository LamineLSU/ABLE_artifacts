do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes -

        "response_text": "To solve this problem, we will follow the reasoning strategy outlined above:\n\n**Phase 1: Establish the factual outcome**\n\nThe program exits at two different locations: `000861F8` and `0040E7FF`. The exact instruction sequence leading to exit is not provided in the given code snippet.\n\n**Phase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses**\n\nFor each suspicious instruction, we will ask \"What if this instruction were skipped?\" and \"Would the program continue instead of exiting?\"\n\nLet's analyze the instructions at `000861F8`:\n\n1. `FF152CA10800`: This is a CALL instruction that calls a function at address `0008A12Ch`.\n2. `53`: This is a PUSH instruction that pushes the value `ebx` onto the stack.\n3. `33FF`: This is an XOR instruction that xors the value in `edi` with itself.\n\n**Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis**\n\nWe will evaluate the counterfactuals for each of these instructions:\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* If the CALL instruction at `000861F8` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely prevent the program from exiting.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* If the PUSH instruction at `000861F8` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* If the XOR instruction at `000861F8` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that skipping the CALL instruction at `000861F8` is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the program from exiting.\n\n**Phase 4: Select the 3 best bypass points**\n\nWe have identified one candidate bypass point at `000861F8`. We need to identify two more bypass points. Let's analyze the instructions at `0040E7FF`:\n\n1. `FF15ACB04100`: This is a CALL instruction that calls a function at address `0041B0ACh`.\n2. `59`: This is a POP instruction that pops the value from the top of the stack into `ecx`.\n3. `53`: This is a PUSH instruction that pushes the value `ebx` onto the stack.\n\nWe can evaluate the counterfactuals for these instructions in a similar manner:\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* If the CALL instruction at `0040E7FF` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely prevent the program from exiting.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* If the POP instruction at `0040E7FF` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* If the PUSH instruction at `0040E7FF` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that skipping the CALL instruction at `0040E7FF` is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the program from exiting.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nWe have identified three candidate bypass points:\n\n1. `000861F8`: Skipping the CALL instruction would likely prevent the program from exiting.\n2. `0040E7FF`: Skipping the CALL instruction would likely prevent the program from exiting.\n\nLet's build patterns for these two instructions:\n\n**Pattern 1:**\n`85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF 15 ???? ?? ?? ?? 53`\n\nThis pattern includes the CALL instruction at `000861F8`, as well as surrounding context instructions. We will use wildcards (??) to replace address bytes.\n\n**Pattern 2:**\n`FF 15 ACB0 4100 59 53 FF 15 ??? B04100`\n\nThis pattern includes the CALL instruction at `0040E7FF`, as well as surrounding context instructions. We will use wildcards (??) to replace address bytes.\n\nWe need to build one more pattern from the TRACE DATA. Let's analyze the instructions at `00086218`:\n\n1. `E80D0C0000`: This is a CALL instruction that calls a function at address `00086E2Ah`.\n2. `CC`: This is an INT3 instruction.\n3. `55`: This is a PUSH instruction that pushes the value `ebp` onto the stack.\n\nWe can evaluate the counterfactuals for these instructions in a similar manner:\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* If the CALL instruction at `00086218` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely prevent the program from exiting.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* If the INT3 instruction at `00086218` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* If the PUSH instruction at `00086218` were skipped, would execution continue?\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: Skipping this instruction would likely not affect the program's behavior.\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No.\n\nBased on these evaluations, we can conclude that skipping the CALL instruction at `00086218` is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the program from exiting.\n\n**Pattern 3:**\n`E8 ?? ???? E0D0C0000 CC 55`\n\nThis pattern includes the CALL instruction at `00086218`, as well as surrounding context instructions. We will use wildcards (??) to replace address bytes.\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**\n\nHere is the output in YARA format:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nWe will replace `[6-20 bytes with wildcards]` with the three patterns we built:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ??

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

To address this issue, we will apply the key principles of learning from failures and using momentum.\n\n## PATTERN_TYPE\nWe will select patterns related to evasion checks (STRATEGY A) as our primary targets. This involves identifying CALL instructions followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE operations, which are common in evasion techniques.\n\n## CONFIDENCE\nGiven the feedback and analysis, we assign a confidence level of 60% to the initial pattern selection.\n\n## REASONING\nOur reasoning for selecting these patterns is based on their prevalence in evasion techniques. By targeting CALL instructions followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE operations, we aim to identify the decision-making points where the malware may be evading detection.\n\n## YARA_RULE\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\nWe have selected three patterns that match common evasion techniques:\n\n1. `$pattern0` targets the CALL instruction followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE operations.\n2. `$pattern1` identifies a specific sequence of instructions related to conditional checks before exit.\n3. `$pattern2` looks for unique instruction sequences associated with timing or VM detection.\n\nThese patterns are designed to be specific enough to hit the target but generic enough to accommodate variants. We will monitor the performance of this rule and adjust it as needed based on execution feedback.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n",
