We need to identify the exact instruction sequence leading to exit. In this case, it's `0041E21F` where `FFD0` (call eax) is executed three times in a row.\n\n**Phase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses**\n\nLet's analyze each suspicious instruction:\n\n*   **Counterfactual 1:** Instruction at line X (`0041E1A4`)\n    -   Factual: This instruction executes → leads to exit\n    -   Counterfactual: If skipped → would execution continue?\n    -   Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes\n    -   Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No (skipping only one instruction doesn't cause the program to continue)\n\n*   **Counterfactual 2:** Instruction at line Y (`0041E1CE`)\n    -   Factual: This instruction executes → leads to exit\n    -   Counterfactual: If skipped → would execution continue?\n    -   Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes\n    -   Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No (skipping only one instruction doesn't cause the program to continue)\n\n*   **Counterfactual 3:** Instruction at line Z (`0041E21F`)\n    -   Factual: This instruction executes → leads to exit\n    -   Counterfactual: If skipped → would execution continue?\n    -   Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes\n    -   Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No (skipping only one instruction doesn't cause the program to continue)\n\n**Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis**\n\nBased on our analysis, we selected instructions where skipping is likely sufficient to bypass evasion. The target instructions are `0041E1A4`, `0041E1CE`, and `0041E21F`.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nLet's combine the target instruction with 2-3 adjacent instructions:\n\n*   **Pattern 0:** Combine `0041E1A4` (`FFD2`) with surrounding context\n    -   Pattern: `52 8B16 50 51 FFD2`\n*   **Pattern 1:** Combine `0041E1CE` (`E8740A0000`) with surrounding context\n    -   Pattern: `56 50 E8740A0000 8B5514 8B4510`\n*   **Pattern 2:** Combine `0041E21F` (`FFD0`) with surrounding context\n    -   Pattern: `52 FFD0`\n\n**Phase 6: Apply wildcard rules**\n\nWe need to apply wildcards for address/offset bytes:\n\n*   **Pattern 0:** Replace CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n    -   Wildcarded pattern: `52 ?? ?? ?? FFD2`\n*   **Pattern 1:** Replace Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n    -   Wildcarded pattern: `56 50 E8????? ????? 8B5514`\n*   **Pattern 2:** Replace CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n    -   Wildcarded pattern: `52 FFD0`\n\n**Phase 7: Format the output**\n\nCreate a Yara rule with the extracted patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nReplace `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, and `$pattern2` with the wildcarded patterns.\n\n**Phase 8: Requirements**\n\nVerify that each pattern meets the requirements:\n\n*   All three patterns must be different hex sequences.\n*   Each pattern must be between 6-20 bytes long (combine multiple instructions).\n*   Add context bytes after CALL/JMP to avoid triggering new signatures.\n*   Use wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n*   Keep opcode and register bytes concrete.",
