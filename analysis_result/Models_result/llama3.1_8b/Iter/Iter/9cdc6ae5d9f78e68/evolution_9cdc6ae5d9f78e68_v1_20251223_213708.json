      "raw_response": "Based on the provided instructions, I will extract three different bypass candidates, build patterns around them, and create a YARA rule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify suspicious instructions**\n\n- Conditional jumps (JE, JNE, JZ, JNZ)\n- Test/compare instructions (TEST, CMP)\n- Function calls (CALL)\n\n**Step 2: Trace the exit path backwards**\n\nThe exit instruction is `FF15A8302E01` at address `012CFC54`. Tracing back:\n\n1. The previous instruction is `59` (POP ECX) at address `012CFC51`.\n2. Before that, it's `E84E000000` (CALL 012CFC9Eh) at address `012CFC4B`.\n3. Further back, we find `FF7508` (PUSH [EBP+08]) at addresses `012CFC48` and `012CFC4B`. This seems to be a key instruction in the evasion mechanism.\n\n**Step 3: Select 3 different bypass candidates**\n\n1. The exit point itself: `FF15A8302E01`\n2. The POP ECX instruction right before it: `59` at address `012CFC51`.\n3. A test/compare instruction that seems to be part of the evasion mechanism: `64A130000000` (MOV EAX, DWORD PTR FS:[00000030h]) at address `012CFC28`.\n\n**Step 4: Build patterns**\n\n1. **Pattern 0**: Exit point\n   - `FF15A8302E01`\n   \n   This is a single instruction and needs to be combined with adjacent instructions or additional context.\n\n2. **Pattern 1**: POP ECX (right before exit)\n   - `59` at address `012CFC51`\n   - Combine it with the next instruction: `FF7508` at address `012CFC4B`\n   \n   This is already a contiguous sequence of instructions but needs to be expanded or combined further.\n\n3. **Pattern 2**: Test/compare (evasion mechanism)\n   - `64A130000000` at address `012CFC28`\n   - Combine it with adjacent instructions: `8B4068`, `C1E808`, and `A801`\n\n**Step 5: Apply wildcards and generate the YARA rule**\n\nGiven the instruction addresses and the need to create a rule that matches these specific sequences, we have to ensure each pattern is between 6-20 bytes long.\n\nHowever, based on the direct extraction from the trace provided:\n\n1. **Pattern 0** needs expansion or combination with adjacent instructions to meet the length requirement.\n2. **Pattern 1** already meets the length requirement but can be combined for specificity.\n3. **Pattern 2** is close but may need minor adjustments for exact length and pattern uniqueness.\n\nGiven these constraints and the instruction at hand, here's a simplified version of what the YARA rule could look like:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEF E8B7B20000 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 FF1540302E01 50 FF1544302E01 ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 64A130000000 8B4068 C1E808 A801 7510 ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example based on the provided instructions and might not perfectly match the exact requirements for pattern length, uniqueness, or specificity. For a precise bypass rule, further analysis may be necessary to ensure each pattern meets the critical criteria (6-20 bytes long, unique sequences, etc.).",
