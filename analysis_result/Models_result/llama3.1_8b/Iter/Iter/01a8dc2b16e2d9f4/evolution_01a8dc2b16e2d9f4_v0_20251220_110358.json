This suggests that the evasion check is happening early in the process, possibly as part of the decision-making for exit.\n\n**PATTERN EXAMPLE**\n```yara\n$p1 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n```\nThis pattern matches the CALL TEST EAX JE/JNE sequence and is specific enough to hit the target but generic enough to allow for variants.

I'll use concrete bytes from the trace and only use wildcards for address/offset bytes.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: The patterns are selected based on common evasion techniques used by malware, specifically targeting the exit-related instructions as bypass points.
