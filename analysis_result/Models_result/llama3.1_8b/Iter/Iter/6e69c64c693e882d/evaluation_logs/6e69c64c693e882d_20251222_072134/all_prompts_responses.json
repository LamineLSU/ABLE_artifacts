(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.

      "response_text": "**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective**\n\nThe malware author is trying to evade detection by a sandbox or VM. The evasion checks are likely implemented to detect the presence of analysis tools or debugger.\n\nUpon examining the trace, I notice that the call instructions (E8C8FFFFFF and FF15ACB04100) seem suspicious. These calls might be used to check for specific conditions, such as the presence of a sandbox or VM.\n\n**Check 1:** The first instruction (E8C8FFFFFF) checks if the system is running in a sandbox or VM by calling a function at address 0040E7C3h. If this function returns a value indicating that the system is not a sandbox or VM, then the execution continues.\n\n**Check 2:** The second call instruction (FF15ACB04100) checks if the system is running in a debugger. This instruction calls a function at address 0041B0ACh, which likely checks for debugger presence.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective**\n\nTo bypass this evasion, we need to manipulate the decision points where the evasion checks are performed.\n\nIf we skip the first call instruction (E8C8FFFFFF), the malware author's check is neutralized because it will not detect the sandbox or VM. This would allow us to continue execution without triggering the evasion.\n\n**Target 1:** If I skip the first call instruction (E8C8FFFFFF), the attacker's check is neutralized because it will not detect the sandbox or VM.\n\nIf we skip the second call instruction (FF15ACB04100), the malware author's check for debugger presence will fail, and execution continues.\n\n**Target 2:** If I skip the second call instruction (FF15ACB04100), the evasion fails because it cannot detect the debugger.\n\nWe should also investigate other potential bypass points. \n\nHowever, without further analysis of the code and its behavior in various environments, we can't be certain about the effectiveness of these bypasses or if they would break legitimate functionality.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nThe chosen bypass points (skipping the first call instruction and skipping the second call instruction) are potential targets for manipulation. However, it's essential to consider whether the malware author could easily detect or counter these bypasses.\n\nAssuming that the evasion checks are not too complex, it's likely that the attacker would try to adapt their evasion logic to detect these bypasses. Therefore, we need to ensure that our chosen bypass points are robust and less likely to be detected by the malware author.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on the analysis above, I select the following three DIFFERENT bypass targets:\n\n1. Skip the first call instruction (E8C8FFFFFF)\n2. Skip the second call instruction (FF15ACB04100)\n3. Manipulate the conditional jump instructions to avoid triggering the evasion checks.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, I combine it with adjacent instructions and apply wildcards as necessary. Here are three example patterns:\n\n**Pattern 1:** `E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF D0 ?? ?? ?? ??` (CALL instruction + surrounding context)\n\n**Pattern 2:** `FF ?? ?? ?? ?? AC B0 ?? ?? ?? ??` (CALL instruction + surrounding context)\n\n**Pattern 3:** `85 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B ?? ?? ?? ??` (TEST instruction + MOV instruction)\n\nThese patterns are designed to be specific enough to match only the target location, while also avoiding detection by the malware author.\n\nHere is the final output in Yara format:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ??

Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

Tracing backwards, we find:\n\n- The instruction directly before the ExitProcess call is `FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`.\n- This function call is a conditional jump that led to the exit path.\n- However, without additional information about the code at `0041B0ACh`, we cannot determine what check determined the direction of this jump.\n\n### Step 3: Select 3 Different Bypass Candidates\n\nWe can select three different bypass candidates based on their positions in the trace:\n\n- The first candidate is the instruction at `0040E7C3h` which is called by both ExitProcess instructions.\n- The second candidate is the `FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]` instruction that directly precedes the ExitProcess instruction in both traces.\n- The third candidate is the `59               pop ecx` instruction that follows the function call at `0040E7C3h`.\n\n### Step 4: Build Patterns (6-20 bytes each)\n\nFor each candidate, we can combine it with adjacent instructions to create a specific pattern:\n\n- For the first candidate (`0040E7C3h`), we can build a pattern like this: `8B FF 55 8BE5 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59`\n- For the second candidate (`FF15ACB04100     call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]`), we can build a pattern like this: `E8 C8 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF`\n- For the third candidate (`59               pop ecx`), we can build a pattern like this: `59 8B EC 5D C3 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n### Step 5: Apply Wildcards and Generate the YARA Rule\n\nReplacing address/offset bytes with `??`, we get:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B FF 55 8BE5 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 }\n        $pattern1 = { E8 C8 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF }\n        $pattern2 = { 59 8B EC 5D C3 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is a simplified example and actual YARA rules may require more complex patterns to ensure accuracy.",

Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.

      "response_text": "Based on the feedback and the original trace, I will evolve a new YARA bypass rule.\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: The previous rule hit but did not produce any new signatures, indicating that it was matching too closely to the target.

The first pattern ($pattern0) specifically targets the test+je+mov sequence, which is a common decision-making process leading to program termination. The second pattern ($pattern1) targets a concrete byte sequence (cmp+je+mov), while the third pattern ($pattern2) targets a concrete comparison value (cmp eax,imm32 + jb).
