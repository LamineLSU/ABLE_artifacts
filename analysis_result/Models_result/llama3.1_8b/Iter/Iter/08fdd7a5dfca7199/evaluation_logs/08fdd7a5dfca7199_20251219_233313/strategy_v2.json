        "response_text": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the instructions provided and generate three bypass points for malware evasion.\n\n### Phase 1: Establish the factual outcome\n- The program exits (this is the observed fact)\n- Identify the exact instruction sequence leading to exit: `0040E7F6` in both traces is where the execution terminates.\n\n### Phase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses\n\nWe will examine each instruction and determine whether skipping it would allow the malware to continue executing instead of exiting. For brevity, we'll focus on the critical instructions leading to exit.\n\n*Counterfactual 1:* `0040E7F6` - This is the call instruction that leads to exit.\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes, since it directly leads to ExitProcess.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n*Counterfactual 2:* `0040E7FF` - This is another call instruction leading up to the exit.\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes, since it directly calls a function that likely contributes to the exit process.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n*Counterfactual 3:* `0040E7C3h` - This instruction is called by both the above instructions and could potentially be the target for evasion.\n- Factual: This instruction executes \u2192 leads to exit\n- Counterfactual: If skipped \u2192 would execution continue?\n- Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? Yes, since it's a critical part of the exit process.\n- Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes.\n\n### Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis\nAll three identified instructions are necessary and sufficient for preventing evasion. We will now create patterns around these instructions.\n\n### Building Patterns\n\n1. **Pattern 1:** For `0040E7F6`, we'll include the call instruction plus surrounding context.\n   - Instruction at `0040E7F6`: E8 C8FFFFFF (call)\n   - Surrounding instructions: \n     - `0040E7C3h` is called, so we'll start with that and add a few bytes around it to ensure specificity.\n     - This pattern will be specific enough since we're including the call instruction and its surrounding code.\n\n2. **Pattern 2:** For `0040E7FF`, we follow a similar approach as above.\n   - Instruction at `0040E7FF`: FF15ACB04100 (call)\n   - Surrounding instructions: \n     - Similar to Pattern 1, we'll start with the call instruction and add surrounding context.\n\n3. **Pattern 3:** For `0040E7C3h`, we continue our approach of including the instruction plus surrounding code.\n   - Instruction at `0040E7C3h`: This is a bit tricky since it's not directly an exit point but part of the critical path leading to exit.\n   - We'll include this instruction and enough context around it to ensure specificity.\n\n### Writing Patterns\n\n1. **Pattern 1:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? E8 C8FFFFFF`\n2. **Pattern 2:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF15ACB04100`\n3. **Pattern 3:** This one might require a bit more thought to include sufficient context while keeping it within the 6-20 byte limit.\n\n### Finalizing Patterns\n\nGiven the constraints, we'll adjust Pattern 3 slightly to fit the necessary instructions and still ensure evasion.\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = {85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? E8 C8FFFFFF}\n        $pattern1 = {6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF15ACB04100}\n        $pattern2 = {8B C4 83 EC ?? ?? ?? ?? B9 ?? ?? ?? ?? F0 CB}\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### Output\n\nThe final YARA rule is provided above. This rule will detect the malware evasion techniques by looking for specific patterns in memory that correspond to the bypass points identified.\n\n**Note:** The final pattern for `0040E7C3h` was adjusted slightly to fit within the 6-20 byte limit while still including necessary context.",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n",
