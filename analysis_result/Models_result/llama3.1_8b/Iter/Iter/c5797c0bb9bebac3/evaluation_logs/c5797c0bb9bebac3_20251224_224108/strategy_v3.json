(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Extract exactly 3 patterns ($pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2)\n2. All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5. Use wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n6. Keep opcode and register bytes concrete\n7. Format: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n8. cape_options references patterns as $pattern0, $pattern1, $pattern2",

        "response_text": "Based on the provided malware execution trace that terminates early due to sandbox/VM evasion, I will follow the reasoning strategy outlined above to identify potential bypass points and create corresponding Yara rules.\n\n## Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)\n\nFrom the attacker's perspective, it appears that the evasion checks are implemented in the following locations:\n\n- Check 1: `0040E7F6` - This is where the malware calls a function at address `0040E7C3h`, which could be checking for sandbox/VM conditions.\n- Check 2: `0040E7FF` - This is where the malware calls a function at address `0041B0ACh`, which might be another evasion check.\n\n## Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)\n\nFrom the defender's perspective, potential decision points to manipulate are:\n\n- Target 1: If I skip `E8C8FFFFFF` (call instruction), the attacker's first check is neutralized because it's likely a sandbox/VM detection function.\n- Target 2: If I skip `FF15ACB04100` (call instruction), the evasion fails because this might be another detection function.\n\n## Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis\n\nConsidering the robustness of each bypass:\n\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass? Yes, they might modify the evasion checks or use more sophisticated methods.\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality? Yes, it's targeted at the evasion checks and shouldn't affect normal execution.\n\n## Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points\n\nChoosing top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis:\n\n1. Bypass point 1: `E8C8FFFFFF` (call instruction)\n2. Bypass point 2: `FF15ACB04100` (call instruction)\n3. Bypass point 3: Not applicable, as only two potential bypass points were identified.\n\n## Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with adjacent instructions and apply wildcards:\n\n1. Pattern for `E8C8FFFFFF`:\n```yara\n$pattern0 = { E8 C8 FF FF FF ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n```\n\n2. Pattern for `FF15ACB04100`:\n```yara\n$pattern1 = { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n```\n\nSince there's no third bypass point, we can ignore this phase.\n\n## Phase 6: Format the Yara rule\n\nUsing the selected patterns and formatting according to the provided guidelines:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8 C8 FF FF FF ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { FF 15 AC B0 41 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is the Yara rule created above.",
