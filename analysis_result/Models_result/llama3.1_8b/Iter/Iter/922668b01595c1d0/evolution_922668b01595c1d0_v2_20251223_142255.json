The exact instruction sequence leading to exit is as follows:\n\n* TRACE #1: `0041B93C FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]`\n* TRACE #2: `0220BBA3 FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]`\n* TRACE #3: `0041B93C FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]`\n\n**Phase 2: Generate counterfactual hypotheses**\n\nFor each suspicious instruction, we will ask:\n\n* \"What if this instruction were skipped?\"\n* \"Would the program continue instead of exiting?\"\n\nLet's analyze the instructions leading up to the `ExitProcess` call in TRACE #1.\n\n**Instruction sequence leading up to ExitProcess (TRACE #1)**\n\n```\n0041B901 8BFF mov edi, edi\n0041B903 55 push ebp\n0041B904 8BEC mov ebp, esp\n0041B906 E8F7250000 call 0041DF02h\n0041B90B 83F801 cmp eax, 01h\n0041B90E 7420 je 0041B930h\n0041B910 64A130000000 mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]\n0041B916 8B4068 mov eax, dword ptr [eax+68h]\n0041B919 C1E808 shr eax, 08h\n0041B91C A801 test al, 01h\n0041B91E 7510 jne 0041B930h\n0041B920 FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n0041B923 FF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]\n0041B929 50 push eax\n0041B92A FF1540F14200 call dword ptr [0042F140h]\n0041B930 FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n0041B933 E80B000000 call 0041B943h\n0041B938 59 pop ecx\n0041B939 FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n>>> 0041B93C FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n```\n\n**Counterfactual 1: Skipping the instruction at line X**\n\n* Instruction at line X: `E8F7250000 call 0041DF02h`\n* Factual: This instruction executes → leads to exit\n* Counterfactual: If skipped → would execution continue?\n* Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit? No, the program will still execute other instructions.\n* Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? No, the program will still call `ExitProcess` at a later point.\n\n**Counterfactual 2: Skipping the instruction at line Y**\n\n* Instruction at line Y: `FF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]`\n* Factual: This instruction executes → leads to exit\n* Counterfactual: If skipped → would execution continue?\n* Necessity: Is skipping this NECESSARY to prevent exit?

Yes, the program will not execute `ExitProcess` if this instruction is skipped.\n* Sufficiency: Is skipping this SUFFICIENT to prevent exit? Yes, the program will not execute `ExitProcess` if this instruction is skipped.\n\n**Phase 3: Evaluate each hypothesis**\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that:\n\n1. Skipping the instruction at line Z (`FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]`) is necessary and sufficient to prevent exit.\n2. The other instructions do not have this property.\n\n**Phase 4: Select the best bypass points**\n\nThe only instruction that meets the criteria for a bypass point is the one at line Z (`FF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]`).\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nBased on the selected bypass point, we can combine it with adjacent instructions to create a pattern. Here are three possible patterns:\n\nPattern 1:\n```\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]\nFF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n```\n\nPattern 2:\n```\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF1540F14200 call dword ptr [0042F140h]\nFF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n```\n\nPattern 3:\n```\nE80B000000 call 0041B943h\n59 pop ecx\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF15A0F14200 call dword ptr [0042F1A0h]\n```\n\nEach pattern is between 6-20 bytes long and includes the target instruction plus surrounding context instructions.\n\n**Wildcard usage**\n\nWe will use wildcards (`??`) for all address/offset bytes in the patterns. For example, `FF15A0F14200` becomes `FF15??F1??0h`.\n\nHere are the final patterns with wildcards:\n\nPattern 1:\n```\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch]\nFF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????]\n```\n\nPattern 2:\n```\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF1540F14200 call dword ptr [0042F140h]\nFF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????]\n```\n\nPattern 3:\n```\nE80B000000 call 0041B943h\n59 pop ecx\nFF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h]\nFF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????]\n```\n\n**Output format**\n\nHere is the final YARA rule with the three patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] FF153CF14200 call dword ptr [0042F13Ch] FF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????] }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] FF1540F14200 call dword ptr [0042F140h] FF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????] }\n        $pattern2 = { E80B000000 call 0041B943h 59 pop ecx FF7508 push dword ptr [ebp+08h] FF15??F1??0h call dword ptr [???????] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nNote that this is just one possible set of patterns, and there may be other bypass points in the code.",
