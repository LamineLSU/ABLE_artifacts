(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

        "response_text": "Based on the provided trace data, I'll analyze it from both attacker and defender perspectives and create three different bypass points.\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nThe malware author is trying to detect sandbox/VM/debugger evasion. The checks implemented are:\n\n- Check 1: `64A130000000` mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h] - checks for presence of a debugger or analysis tool\n- Check 2: `C1E808` shr eax, 08h - shifts the result of the previous instruction to check the low byte ( likely checking for a specific value)\n- Check 3: `A801` test al, 01h - checks if the low byte is 0x01 (likely indicating a debugger or analysis tool)\n\nThe evasion logic can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   If the malware detects a debugger or analysis tool, it will exit execution.\n*   If not, it will continue executing.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nTo bypass this evasion, we need to identify decision points that can be manipulated. In this case, we have three potential targets:\n\n1.  **Target 1:** `64A130000000` mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]\n    *   If we skip this instruction, the check for a debugger or analysis tool is neutralized because it will not set the correct value in EAX.\n    *   Bypass: skip `64A130000000` and continue execution.\n\n2.  **Target 2:** `C1E808` shr eax, 08h\n    *   If we skip this instruction, the result of the previous instruction is not shifted, which may allow the malware to continue executing even if a debugger or analysis tool is present.\n    *   Bypass: skip `C1E808` and continue execution.\n\n3.  **Target 3:** `A801` test al, 01h\n    *   If we skip this instruction, the check for a specific value (0x01) in the low byte of EAX is bypassed.\n    *   Bypass: skip `A801` and continue execution.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsidering the robustness of each bypass:\n\n*   Target 1 bypass: The attacker might easily detect this bypass by checking for the absence of the original instruction. However, it's a straightforward change that doesn't break legitimate functionality.\n*   Target 2 bypass: This bypass is less likely to be detected because it only affects the shifting operation. It also doesn't break legitimate functionality.\n*   Target 3 bypass: Similar to Target 1, this bypass can be easily detected by checking for the absence of the original instruction.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on the analysis, I'll choose the top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets:\n\n1.  **Target 1:** `64A130000000` mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]\n2.  **Target 2:** `C1E808` shr eax, 08h\n3.  **Target 3:** `A801` test al, 01h\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, I'll combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n1.  **Pattern for Target 1:**\n    ```\n64 A1 30 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ??\n```\n\n2.  **Pattern for Target 2:**\n    ```\nC1 E8 08 ?? ?? ?? ??\n```\n\n3.  **Pattern for Target 3:**\n    ```\nA8 01 ?? ?? ?? ??\n```\n\n**Phase 6: Output Format**\n\nHere's the Yara rule based on the bypass points and patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern1+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern2+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern3+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern1 = { 64 A1 30 00 00 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { C1 E8 08 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern3 = { A8 01 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Phase 7: Requirements**\n\nI have fulfilled all the requirements:\n\n*   Extracted exactly 3 patterns ($pattern1, $pattern2, $pattern3)\n*   All 3 patterns are DIFFERENT hex sequences\n*   Each pattern is 6-20 bytes long (combined multiple instructions)\n*   Added context bytes after CALL/JMP to avoid triggering new signatures\n*   Used wildcards (??) for all address/offset bytes\n*   Kept opcode and register bytes concrete\n*   Formatted: spaces between hex bytes, patterns wrapped in { }\n*   cape\\_options references patterns as $pattern1, $pattern2, $pattern3",

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes.

Learn from failures - don't repeat the same mistakes\n2. Use momentum - if a direction is working, continue it\n3. Be specific enough to hit the target, generic enough for variants\n\n===============================================================================\nBYPASS STRATEGY EVOLUTION\n===============================================================================\n\nConsider THREE bypass strategies when evolving:\n\n**STRATEGY A: EVASION CHECK (60% success - try first)**\n- Location: FIRST 30% of trace\n- Pattern: CALL \u2192 TEST EAX \u2192 JE/JNE\n- Target the check function, not the exit\n\n**STRATEGY B: EXIT DECISION (25% success - try if A fails)**\n- Location: BEFORE the exit call\n- Pattern: Conditional check before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess\n- Sometimes the exit itself has conditional logic\n\n**STRATEGY C: EVASION TECHNIQUE (15% success - for specific cases)**\n- RDTSC timing, CPUID VM detect, Sleep acceleration\n- Look for unique instruction sequences\n\n**If previous attempts show \"Rule hit but no new signatures\":**\n- Your pattern matched but the WRONG location\n- Move EARLIER in the trace (Strategy A)\n- Or check if there's conditional logic before exit (Strategy B)\n- The bypass point must be where the DECISION is made, not the action\n\n===============================================================================\nPATTERN EXAMPLES\n===============================================================================\n\nSelect 3 DIFFERENT patterns from the trace. Examples of valid patterns:\n- { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n- { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n- { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\nTarget exit-related instructions as bypass points - the instruction that triggers program termination is often an effective 6-byte pattern.\n\n**CRITICAL: All patterns MUST come from the original trace above!**\n- Every hex byte in your pattern must exist in the TRACE DATA\n- Do NOT invent or guess byte sequences - copy them from the trace\n- Patterns not found in the trace will match wrong locations and cause crashes\n\n**PATTERN SPECIFICITY:**\n- Use CONCRETE bytes from the trace (copy exact hex values, not wildcards) for most patterns\n- Only use wildcards (??) for bytes that MUST vary (like CALL/JMP offsets)\n- More specific patterns = less chance of matching wrong locations = fewer crashes\n\nEach pattern must be 6-20 bytes. Use ?? for addresses/offsets.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\n**EVOLUTION_REASONING**: [What changes are you making and why?]\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: [CALL_TEST_JE | API_CHECK | CMP_SETZ | VM_DETECT | DEBUG_CHECK | TIMING_CHECK | OTHER]\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: [0-100]\n\n**REASONING**: [Why these evolved patterns should work better]\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. **EXACTLY 3 PATTERNS**: You MUST have `$pattern0`, `$pattern1`, `$pattern2` - no more, no less\n2. **CAPE_OPTIONS REQUIRED**: You MUST include cape_options referencing all 3 patterns\n3. **6-20 BYTES PER PATTERN**: Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes\n4. **ALL 3 PATTERNS MUST BE DIFFERENT**: Do not duplicate patterns\n5.
