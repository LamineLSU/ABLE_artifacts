This indicates that our previous attempts targeted the wrong locations or had too much specificity. We need to adjust our approach to be more specific while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE (Strategy A: Evasion Check)\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**: Our new strategy focuses on evasion checks, specifically targeting the conditional logic before the exit function is called. This should provide a good balance between specificity and generality.\n\n**YARA_RULE**:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B FF 55 8BE C D3 D0 00 E8 CD 3D 00 00 }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D FC }\n        $pattern2 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n**Pattern Explanation:**\n\n* `$pattern0` targets the CALL instruction that leads to the conditional logic before exit. It includes the CALL opcode, followed by the target address (which we don't know yet).\n* `$pattern1` targets the CMP instruction with a specific offset (8 bytes). This is a common pattern for checking conditions.\n* `$pattern2` targets another CALL instruction with a specific offset (4 bytes). This is similar to `$pattern0`, but has a different target address.\n\nThese patterns should provide a good starting point for our bypass rule, targeting the evasion checks and conditional logic before the exit function. We will continue to refine these patterns based on further analysis and feedback.",

The second and third patterns target specific conditional checks before exit.\n\nNote: Each pattern is 6-20 bytes as required.",
