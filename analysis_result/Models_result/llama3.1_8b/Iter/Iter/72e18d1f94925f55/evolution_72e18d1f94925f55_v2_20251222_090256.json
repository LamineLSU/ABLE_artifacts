This suggests that our pattern matched but was triggered at an incorrect location or with too much generality. We will try to pinpoint the exact instruction that makes the exit decision.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**\nAPI_CHECK\n\n**CONFIDENCE**\n80%\n\n**REASONING**\nBased on the trace, we notice that both exit calls (009B6566 and 00136567) are preceded by a conditional check. Specifically, the `test` instruction is followed by a conditional jump (`je/jne`). We will target this sequence as our first pattern.\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF 55 8BEC E8CD3D0000 83F801 7420 }\n        $pattern1 = { 64A130000000 8B4068 C1E808 A801 7510 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF7508 E80B000000 59 FF7508 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nIn this rule, we have identified three patterns:\n\n* `$pattern0` targets the initial `test` instruction and its following conditional jump.\n* `$pattern1` focuses on the `mov eax, dword ptr fs:[00000030h]` sequence that retrieves the address from the thread's TEB structure. This is a specific indicator of an API call, which often precedes exit functions.\n* `$pattern2` captures the instruction right before the exit call (`push eax`) and the following conditional check.\n\nBy combining these three patterns with a `cape_options` string referencing each pattern, we aim to pinpoint the exact instruction that makes the exit decision. This should allow us to skip the incorrect locations where our previous rules triggered.",
