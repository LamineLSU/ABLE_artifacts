      "raw_response": "Here is the detailed answer to the problem:\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nThe malware author implemented evasion checks to detect sandbox/VM environments and analysis tools. The evasion logic involves checking for certain conditions in the system and exiting the process if these conditions are met.\n\n* Check 1: [Instruction] - `E8C8FFFFFF` (CALL instruction) checks if the current instruction pointer is within a specific range, indicating a potential sandbox/VM environment.\n* Check 2: [Instruction] - `FF7508` (PUSH instruction) pushes a value onto the stack, and then checks the top of the stack for a specific pattern. If this pattern is found, it indicates that an analysis tool is present.\n* Check 3: [Instruction] - `FF15ACB04100` (CALL instruction) calls a function at a specific address. This function likely performs additional checks to detect sandbox/VM environments or analysis tools.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThe defender can manipulate the decision points in the evasion logic to bypass the checks. The following instructions, if skipped, would neutralize the evasion:\n\n* Target 1: If I skip `E8C8FFFFFF`, the attacker's check is neutralized because it relies on the CALL instruction being executed.\n* Target 2: If I skip `FF7508`, the evasion fails because it relies on the PUSH instruction and subsequent stack checks.\n* Target 3: If I skip `FF15ACB04100`, execution continues because this function likely performs additional checks that are not critical to the evasion logic.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nThe bypasses selected in Phase 2 have the following properties:\n\n* Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass? Yes, as they would expect a CALL instruction to be executed at `E8C8FFFFFF`.\n* Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality? Yes, as it only affects the evasion logic and does not impact normal program execution.\n* Would this work against variants of this evasion? Yes, as the evasion logic is likely based on the specific conditions checked by these instructions.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on the analysis in Phase 2, I select the following three DIFFERENT bypass targets:\n\n1. `E8C8FFFFFF` (CALL instruction)\n2. `FF7508` (PUSH instruction)\n3. `E9 ?? ?? ?? ??` (JMP instruction)\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, I combine it with adjacent instructions and apply wildcards:\n\n* Pattern 1: `$pattern0 = { E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }`\n\t+ This pattern includes the CALL instruction (`E8C8FFFFFF`) followed by a POP instruction (`59`) and then the PUSH instruction (`FF7508`).\n* Pattern 2: `$pattern1 = { FF7508 ?? ?? 59 FF15ACB04100 }`\n\t+ This pattern includes the PUSH instruction (`FF7508`) followed by two unknown bytes, a POP instruction (`59`), and then the CALL instruction (`FF15ACB04100`).\n* Pattern 3: `$pattern2 = { E9 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }`\n\t+ This pattern includes the JMP instruction (`E9`) followed by four unknown bytes, a TEST instruction (`85 C0`).\n\n**Phase 6: Format patterns and create Yara rule**\n\nHere are the formatted patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8C8FFFFFF 59 FF7508 }\n        $pattern1 = { FF7508 ?? ?? 59 FF15ACB04100 }\n        $pattern2 = { E9 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```",
