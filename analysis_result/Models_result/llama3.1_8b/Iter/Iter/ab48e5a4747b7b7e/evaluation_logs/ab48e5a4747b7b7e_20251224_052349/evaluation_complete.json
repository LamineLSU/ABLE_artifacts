            "response_text": "Here's the detailed analysis of the given malware execution trace that terminates early due to sandbox/VM evasion:\n\n**Phase 1: Attacker's Perspective (Malware Author)**\n\nThe attacker is trying to detect and evade the sandbox or VM environment. The trace shows two similar sequences, which suggests that the evasion checks are likely located at the beginning of the sequence.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we can identify the following evasion checks:\n\n* Check 1: `8BFF` (mov edi, edi) - This instruction is checking if the current process is running in a protected mode or not. If it's not, the malware will exit.\n* Check 2: `55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF` (push ebp, mov ebp, esp, push dword ptr [ebp+08h], call 0040E7C3h) - This sequence is checking for the presence of a debugger or sandbox. If it detects one, the malware will exit.\n\nThe decision point that triggers the exit is likely located at `FF7508` (push dword ptr [ebp+08h]), which loads the value from the stack into the EAX register. If the value indicates a sandbox or VM environment, the malware will exit.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nFrom the defender's perspective, we want to identify the decision points that can be manipulated to bypass the evasion checks. Upon analyzing the sequence, we can identify the following potential bypass points:\n\n* Target 1: If we skip `8BFF` (mov edi, edi), the attacker's check is neutralized because it would no longer be able to determine if the process is running in a protected mode or not.\n* Target 2: If we skip `55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF`, the evasion fails because it would no longer be able to detect the presence of a debugger or sandbox.\n* Target 3: If we skip `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh]), execution continues because it's likely a legitimate function call.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsidering the robustness of each bypass, we can analyze the potential countermeasures that the attacker could take:\n\n* Target 1: If the defender skips `8BFF`, the attacker could modify the code to use a different method to detect protected mode.\n* Target 2: If the defender skips `55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF`, the attacker could implement a more sophisticated evasion technique, such as using a polymorphic payload or encrypting the malware code.\n* Target 3: If the defender skips `FF15ACB04100`, the attacker could modify the function call to point to a malicious location.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on the analysis above, our top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets are:\n\n1. Skipping `8BFF` (mov edi, edi)\n2. Skipping `55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF`\n3. Skipping `FF15ACB04100` (call dword ptr [0041B0ACh])\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, we will combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards to build the following patterns:\n\nPattern 1:\n`8BFF ?? ?? ?? FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF`\n\nPattern 2:\n`55 8BEC FF7508 E8C8FFFFFF ?? ?? ??`\n\nPattern 3:\n`FF15ACB04100 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n**Phase 6: Output Format**\n\nHere is the final YARA rule that includes the bypass patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8BFF ?? ?? ??

(sandbox, VM, debugger, analysis tool?)\n- What checks did I implement to detect it?\n- Where in this trace are my evasion checks?\n- What result triggers the exit vs. continuing execution?\n\nIdentify the attacker's evasion logic:\n- Check 1: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 2: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n- Check 3: [instruction] - checks for [what]\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nThink like a defender trying to bypass this evasion:\n- Where are the decision points I can manipulate?\n- Which instructions, if skipped, would defeat the evasion?\n- What is the minimum intervention needed?\n\nFor each potential bypass point:\n- Target 1: If I skip [instruction], the attacker's check is neutralized because [reason]\n- Target 2: If I skip [instruction], the evasion fails because [reason]\n- Target 3: If I skip [instruction], execution continues because [reason]\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nConsider the robustness of each bypass:\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass?\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality?\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion?\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nChoose your top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards.\n\n---\n\n## PATTERN LENGTH REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)\n\nEach pattern must be **6-20 bytes long** to be specific enough to match only the target location.\n\n**How to build patterns:**\n- Combine 2-3 consecutive instructions from the trace into one pattern\n- Include the target instruction PLUS surrounding context instructions\n- **All patterns MUST come from the TRACE DATA above** - do not invent byte sequences\n\n**Good Example:** `85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ??` (TEST EAX + JZ + MOV = 11 bytes)\n**Good Example:** `6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0` (PUSH + POP + MOV + CALL + TEST = 12 bytes)\n\n---\n\n## WILDCARD RULES\n\n**Wildcard principle:** Any byte that represents an address, offset, or displacement MUST be replaced with `??`\n\n**Apply wildcards to:**\n- CALL/JMP offset bytes (4 bytes after opcode)\n- Conditional jump offsets (1 or 4 bytes after opcode)\n- Memory address bytes\n- Stack offsets\n\n**Keep concrete:** All opcode bytes, register-encoding bytes\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\n1.

Add 4+ context bytes (e.g., TEST/CMP/JZ after the CALL)\n- Generic pattern: $pattern2: Pattern too short (0 bytes, need at least 6)\n- Empty pattern: $pattern2 is empty - must contain byte patterns\n\n---\n\n## YOUR PREVIOUS (INVALID) RULE\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { E8??FF????

Check: matching braces { }, proper hex format with spaces between bytes, and correct string assignment format `$name = { hex bytes }`\n\n**Pattern Length Issue:** Your patterns are too short. Each pattern must be 10-20 bytes.

All 3 patterns must be DIFFERENT hex sequences\n3. **Each pattern must be 6-20 bytes long** (combine multiple instructions)\n4. **Add context bytes after CALL/JMP** to avoid triggering new signatures\n5.
