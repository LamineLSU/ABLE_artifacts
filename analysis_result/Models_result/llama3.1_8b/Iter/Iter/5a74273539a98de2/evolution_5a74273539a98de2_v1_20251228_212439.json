This approach has shown a 60% success rate. I'll create three distinct patterns from the original trace, focusing on concrete bytes and specific instruction sequences.\n\n**PATTERN_TYPE**: CALL_TEST_JE, API_CHECK, CMP_SETZ\n\n**CONFIDENCE**: 80\n\n**REASONING**\nThese evolved patterns should work better because they target the evasion check early in the execution flow. By selecting specific instructions and byte sequences, we increase the likelihood of matching the correct location without causing crashes.\n\n**YARA_RULE**\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC } // test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 } // cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 } // cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\nNote that I've used the exact byte sequences from the original trace and made sure each pattern is unique.
