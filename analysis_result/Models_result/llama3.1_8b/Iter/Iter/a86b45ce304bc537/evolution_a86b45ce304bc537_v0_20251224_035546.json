To generate a YARA bypass rule with exactly 3 different patterns targeting suspicious evasion points, we need to extract the relevant instructions from the trace.\n\nAfter analyzing the trace data, I extracted three distinct patterns that meet the requirements:\n\n**Pattern 1: Evasion Point - CALL Instruction**\n```assembly\nFFD0             call eax\n```\nThis pattern targets a CALL instruction where `eax` is the target address. The surrounding context includes two previous instructions:\n```assembly\n52               push edx\n8B16             mov edx, dword ptr [esi]\n50               push eax\n51               push ecx\n```\nThese instructions are likely involved in setting up the call stack and preparing for the CALL instruction.\n\n**Pattern 2: Evasion Point - JMP Instruction**\n```assembly\nE8 ?? ?? ?? ??   call 0041A950h\n```\nThis pattern targets a CALL instruction with a jump offset. The surrounding context includes several previous instructions:\n```assembly\n55               push ebp\n8BEC             mov ebp, esp\n8B4508           mov eax, dword ptr [ebp+08h]\n56               push esi\n6A35             push 00000035h\n```\nThese instructions are likely involved in setting up the call stack and preparing for the CALL instruction.\n\n**Pattern 3: Evasion Point - MOV Instruction**\n```assembly\n8B06             mov eax, dword ptr [esi]\n```\nThis pattern targets a MOV instruction where `eax` is the destination register. The surrounding context includes several previous instructions:\n```assembly\n52               push edx\n8B16             mov edx, dword ptr [esi]\n50               push eax\n51               push ecx\n```\nThese instructions are likely involved in setting up the call stack and preparing for the MOV instruction.\n\n### Pattern Format\n\nTo format these patterns according to the YARA requirements, I'll replace address/offset bytes with wildcards (??) and keep opcode and register bytes concrete:\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 8B16 50 51 FFD0 }\n        $pattern1 = { 55 8BEC 8B4508 56 6A35 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 52 8B16 50 51 8B06 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### Final Bypass Rule\n\nThe final YARA bypass rule is shown above. This rule targets three distinct patterns that correspond to suspicious evasion points in the malware execution trace. The `cape_options` parameter specifies that each pattern should be skipped when detected, and the `count` parameter is set to 0 to indicate that only one occurrence of any of these patterns is required for a match.",
