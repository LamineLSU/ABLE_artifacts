No, as the attacker relies on specific checks for debugger and VM presence.\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality? Yes, as it only affects specific instructions related to evasion detection.\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion? Potentially, as the attacker's checks are specific and may not be easily modified.\n\n### Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points\n\nChoose top 3 DIFFERENT bypass targets based on the adversarial analysis:\n\n1. Skip `F7 D0` to neutralize debugger detection\n2. Skip `E8 ?? ?? ?? ??` to prevent VM detection attempt\n3. Skip `C3` to continue execution without returning control\n\n### Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)\n\nFor each selected bypass point, combine it with adjacent instructions and apply wildcards:\n\n1. `$pattern0 = { F7 D0 ?? ?? ?? ?? E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }`\n2. `$pattern1 = { 6A ?? 5A 8B CE E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? C3 }`\n3. `$pattern2 = { C3 F3 0F 10 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 ?? }`\n\n### Phase 6: Format Yara Rule\n\nFormat the bypass patterns into a Yara rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { [6-20 bytes with wildcards] }\n        $pattern1 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n        $pattern2 = { [6-20 bytes - DIFFERENT sequence] }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 7: Final Output\n\nThe final output is the formatted Yara rule:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { F7 D0 ?? ?? ?? ??
