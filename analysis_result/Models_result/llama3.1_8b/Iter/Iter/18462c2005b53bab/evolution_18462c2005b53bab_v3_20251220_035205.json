They have implemented the following evasion checks:\n\n- Check 1: `E8 C8FFFFFF` - checks for a specific CALL instruction that might be indicative of a debugger or analysis tool.\n- Check 2: `FF15ACB04100` - checks for a specific memory address, which could indicate the presence of an analysis tool.\n- Check 3: `59 FF7508` - checks for a specific stack offset, which could indicate the presence of a debugger.\n\n**Phase 2: Defender's Perspective (Analyst)**\n\nTo bypass this evasion, we need to identify decision points that can be manipulated. Let's analyze each potential bypass point:\n\n- Target 1: If I skip `E8 C8FFFFFF`, the attacker's check is neutralized because it would no longer detect a specific CALL instruction.\n- Target 2: If I skip `FF15ACB04100`, the evasion fails because it relies on the presence of this specific memory address to trigger.\n- Target 3: If I skip `59 FF7508`, execution continues because it's a stack offset check that can be bypassed.\n\n**Phase 3: Adversarial Game Analysis**\n\nLet's consider the robustness of each bypass:\n\n- Would the attacker easily detect/counter this bypass? The attacker might try to harden their evasion checks, but a well-crafted bypass could still work.\n- Is this bypass specific enough to not break legitimate functionality? In this case, the bypass is targeted at specific evasion checks and should not affect legitimate execution.\n- Would this work against variants of this evasion? A good bypass should be generalizable and apply to multiple variants of the evasion.\n\n**Phase 4: Select 3 different bypass points**\n\nBased on our analysis, we can select the following three DIFFERENT bypass targets:\n\n1. Bypass Target 1: `E8 C8FFFFFF` - skip this CALL instruction to evade Check 1.\n2. Bypass Target 2: `FF15ACB04100` - modify or replace this memory address check to evade Check 2.\n3. Bypass Target 3: `59 FF7508` - modify or replace this stack offset check to evade Check 3.\n\n**Phase 5: Build patterns (6-20 bytes each)**\n\nFor each selected bypass point, we will combine it with 2-3 adjacent instructions and apply wildcards:\n\n1. Bypass Target 1:\n```\nE8 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF7508\n```\n\n2. Bypass Target 2:\n```\nFF15ACB04100 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59\n```\n\n3. Bypass Target 3:\n```\n59 FF7508 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF\n```\n\n**Phase 6: Format and output**\n\nWe will format the patterns according to the provided Yara rule template:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern1+0,action0=skip,bp2=$pattern3+0,action2=skip\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern1 = { E8 C0 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 FF7508 }\n        $pattern2 = { FF15ACB04100 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 59 }\n        $pattern3 = { 59 FF7508 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? FF }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nNote: The `bp1` option is not used in this example, but it can be replaced with the correct pattern and offset if needed.",
