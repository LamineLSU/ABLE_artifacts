To improve upon this, we will focus on identifying specific patterns that are unique to the sample's behavior.\n\n## PATTERN_TYPE\nCALL_TEST_JE (Strategy A: Evasion Check)\n\n## CONFIDENCE\n80\n\n## REASONING\nBased on the original trace, we can identify a pattern that seems to be a call to an evasion function. This pattern consists of CALL, followed by TEST EAX and JE/JNE instructions.\n\n## YARA_RULE\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 8B CE E8 ?????????? 85 C0 0F 84 ????????? }\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\nIn this rule, we've identified three patterns:\n\n1. `$pattern0`: This pattern represents a call to an evasion function (CALL) followed by testing EAX and jumping if the result is zero (TEST EAX, JE). The `?????` wildcards represent the unknown bytes that follow the CALL instruction.\n2. `$pattern1`: This pattern consists of a comparison (CMP) followed by a jump if less than or equal to (JLE).\n3. `$pattern2`: This pattern represents a comparison (CMP) with an immediate value and jumping if below (JB).\n\nThese patterns are designed to capture specific evasion behaviors observed in the original trace, providing a higher confidence level for matching the malware's behavior.",
