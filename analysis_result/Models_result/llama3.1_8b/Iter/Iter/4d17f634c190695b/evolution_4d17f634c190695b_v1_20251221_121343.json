We'll adjust this based on the results of our evolved rule.\n\n## REASONING\nBased on the provided trace data, we've identified three evasion techniques to target. Strategy A (Evasion Check) targets the check function, not the exit, and has a 60% success rate. Strategy B (Exit Decision) checks for conditional logic before ExitProcess/TerminateProcess with a 25% success rate. Strategy C (Evasion Technique) uses unique instruction sequences with a 15% success rate.\n\n## YARA_RULE\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample_Evolved\n{\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule - evolved\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 85 C0 0F 84 ?? ?? ?? ?? 8B 45 FC }  -- test+je+mov (specific stack offset)\n        $pattern1 = { 83 F8 01 74 12 8B 4D F8 }  -- cmp+je+mov (concrete bytes, very specific)\n        $pattern2 = { 3D 00 10 00 00 0F 82 }  -- cmp eax,imm32 + jb (concrete comparison value)\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThe three patterns are selected based on the provided examples and target exit-related instructions as bypass points.
