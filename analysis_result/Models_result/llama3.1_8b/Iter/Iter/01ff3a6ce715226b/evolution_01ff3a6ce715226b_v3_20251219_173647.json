This value is used to detect the presence of a debugger or analysis tool.\n\nTo bypass this check, we can skip the instructions that push the value 37 onto the stack and the subsequent instruction that checks for its presence.\n\n**Target 2:** Bypass Check 3 (Instruction `85 C0`)\n\nThe third check is implemented using the instruction `85 C0`, which is a TEST instruction.
