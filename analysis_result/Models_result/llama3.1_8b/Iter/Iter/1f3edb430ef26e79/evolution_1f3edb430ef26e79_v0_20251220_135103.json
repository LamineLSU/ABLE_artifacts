      "raw_response": "## Bypass Rule Analysis\n\nAfter analyzing the malware execution trace, three evasion points have been identified that demonstrate suspicious behavior. These points will be used to create a YARA bypass rule.\n\n### Pattern 1: Delayed Execution Evasion\n\nThe first evasion point is located at `0041E24F` and involves a call instruction with an address stored in register eax. The surrounding context suggests that this is an attempt to evade detection by delaying the execution of malicious code.\n\n**Pattern 1:** `52 FFD0 E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n*   This pattern combines three instructions: `push edx`, `call eax` (`FFD0`), and a conditional jump instruction with an offset stored in memory (`E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`). The wildcards represent the memory address bytes that store the offset.\n*   Pattern length: 11 bytes\n*   Context: Surrounding instructions suggest that this is part of a delayed execution mechanism.\n\n### Pattern 2: Function Pointer Corruption\n\nThe second evasion point is located at `0041E27F` and involves multiple push instructions followed by a call instruction. This sequence suggests an attempt to corrupt function pointers or create a malicious callback.\n\n**Pattern 2:** `52 8B552C E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`\n\n*   This pattern combines three instructions: `push edx`, `mov edx, [ebp+2Ch]` (`8B552C`), and a conditional jump instruction with an offset stored in memory (`E8 ?? ?? ?? ??`). The wildcards represent the memory address bytes that store the offset.\n*   Pattern length: 11 bytes\n*   Context: Surrounding instructions suggest that this is part of a function pointer corruption mechanism.\n\n### Pattern 3: Evasion through Conditional Jumps\n\nThe third evasion point is located at `0041E29B` and involves multiple push instructions followed by conditional jump instructions. This sequence suggests an attempt to evade detection by creating complex control flow paths.\n\n**Pattern 3:** `52 8B5514 85 C0`\n\n*   This pattern combines three instructions: `push edx`, `mov edx, [ebp+14h]` (`8B5514`), and a test instruction with a conditional jump (`85 C0`). The wildcards are not applicable in this case since the bytes represent opcode rather than addresses or offsets.\n*   Pattern length: 6 bytes\n*   Context: Surrounding instructions suggest that this is part of an evasion mechanism through complex control flow.\n\n## Bypass Rule\n\nNow, let's create a YARA bypass rule using these three patterns:\n\n```yara\nrule Bypass_Sample {\n    meta:\n        description = \"Evasion bypass rule\"\n        cape_options = \"bp0=$pattern0+0,action0=skip,bp1=$pattern1+0,action1=skip,bp2=$pattern2+0,action2=skip,count=0\"\n\n    strings:\n        $pattern0 = { 52 FFD0 E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern1 = { 52 8B552C E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? }\n        $pattern2 = { 52 8B5514 85 C0 }\n\n    condition:\n        any of them\n}\n```\n\nThis rule will skip execution at the specified evasion points, allowing further analysis to focus on other suspicious behaviors.",
